Serpentfolk,"Before their ancient clash with humanity devastated their civilization, serpentfolk were masters of a sprawling underground empire. Few serpentfolk survive today; their power is shattered, their god Ydersius decapitated (although not quite slain). The cunning, intelligence, and magical abilities of serpentfolk have diminished from their ancient heights, and most are born without these boons. Those serpentfolk who retain their ancestry’s legacy of intelligence and magic are known as zyss, and they look down upon their more numerous kindred with a mix of disdain and shame. They see these offshoots as a curse on their kind, resulting from their god’s decapitation and the pandemonium during the fall of their underground empire, and have dubbed them aapoph, meaning “chaos made flesh.” Today, the central realm of the Darklands retains the old name of the serpentfolk empire that once dominated this region—Sekamina. This name is also the source of the serpentfolk’s Aklo title, sekmin, which they are often called in ancient texts. Sekamina itself retains very little of the serpentfolk’s legacy, its mantle of rule having passed on to others like drow, ghouls, gugs, and deep gnomes. Yet in remote reaches of this dangerous realm, the ruins of serpentfolk cities still stand. Within, a great many serpentfolk sleep in torpor in secluded vaults, with only a few cells awake to enact their schemes. In addition, a small number of serpentfolk settlements dot Golarion’s surface, most of them in humid, remote jungles, far-flung islands, or caverns close to the surface. It’s rare for such a settlement to number more than a few dozen serpentfolk. They rely primarily on slaves to build their power bases, to defend them, and to perform essentially all the practical functions of their society. This includes providing food, crafting goods, and tending to the serpentfolk’s every need. Zyss serpentfolk are megalomaniacal geniuses with dreams of returning to their place of dominance, though modern serpentfolk have few means of accomplishing this goal. Many of their plans hinge on resurrecting Ydersius, their decapitated god. His headless body still thrashes about, mindless, in the Darklands, waiting to be reunited with his lost skull. Serpentfolk numbers are so small that reclaiming their dominance seems a distant dream, especially since their reproduction is slow. Though a parent can birth a dozen young at once, the gestation period lasts up to a decade, and the likelihood that even one will be zyss is low. There’s no telling whether a child will be zyss or aapoph, regardless of parentage. A coveted zyss child is just as likely to arise from aapoph parents as from two zyss, and every serpentfolk colony has someone in charge of sorting the young, identifying the earliest signs of intelligence in them. Though the number of zyss is small in serpentfolk colonies, bringing in more zyss isn’t necessarily desirable. A serpentfolk conclave with just a few zyss is functional, but one with a large number becomes fractious. Cults and societies form, all pursuing their own passions and politics, with scheming and backstabbing running rampant. A powerful priest may be able to bring other zyss to heel, but many zyss question why a priest should be in charge if their god is dead. Zyss thrive on selfish desires for hedonistic pleasure and adulation. They feel no love for others, even their offspring. Thriving on decadence, they crave receiving expensive gifts, gorging themselves on massive meals, and pursing arts such as music, poetry, or sculpture. Even more academic hobbies, like the study of magic or warfare, take an artistic bent, like carefully designing colorful illusions or memorizing epic poems about renowned wars. Each zyss believes themself to have more refined tastes than their peers."
Planar Scion,"Many immortals dwell upon the other planes of the Great Beyond. Some are benevolent and kindly, like angels. Others are cruel and destructive, like demons. And some flt roles outside of morality, like psychopomps. It’s far from unheard of that mortals and immortals alike become entangled romantically, and the children of such engagements carry a supernatural element in their bloodlines for generations to follow. After the first generation, this otherworldly influence usually lies dormant, but now and then, the influence can manifest strongly in descendants many years later. These inheritors of extraplanar legacies are known collectively as planar scions."
Demon,"When a sinful mortal soul is judged and sent on to the Abyss, it can become a deadly fiend—a demon. Demons are living incarnations of sin—be they classic sins like wrath or gluttony, or more “specialized” depravities like an obsession with torture or the act of treason or treachery. Once formed, a demon’s driving goals are twofold—the amassing of personal power, and the corruption of mortal souls to cause them to become tainted by sin. In this way demons ensure a never-ending supply of new demons to bolster their ever-growing ranks in the Abyss."
"Elemental, Metal","Metal elementals can manifest in a wide variety of different forms, from shapeless amalgams of different metals to humanoid and beast-like monstrosities."
Devotees,"Religions inspire devout individuals to uphold their tenets. Many of these devotees seek to bring respite and hope, but others have darker motives."
Performers,"Performances can serve as entertainment, expressions of beauty, or part of a shared culture."
Ennosite,"The Astral Plane is a planar nexus, connecting the planes of the Inner Sphere to those of the Outer Sphere, a realm of timeless silver substance charged with mental essence drawn from throughout the Great Beyond. Most creatures on the Astral Plane are visitors—predators seeking to poach from the River of Souls, psychopomps guarding against such incursions, and aeons monitoring the flow of raw quintessence through the Antipode. Yet, this plane has spawned creatures native to its strange currents and eddies, foremost of which is the family of thought-spawned creatures known as ennosites. An ennosite's form physically embodies of its thought and purpose. As some ideals and goals are shared, so are certain forms."
Golem,"Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands— often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure positive energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons. Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts—so-called “golem manuals”—are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master. Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question. Examples of components that can be harvested from golems are listed in the sidebars. Golem Antimagic A golem is immune to spells and magical abilities other than its own, but each type of golem is affected by a few types of magic in special ways. These exceptions are listed in shortened form in the golem's stat block, with the full rules appearing here. If an entry lists multiple types (such as “cold and water”), either type of spell can affect the golem.Harmed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to take the listed amount of damage (this damage has no type) instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of magic of this type or is affected by a persistent effect of the appropriate type, it takes the damage listed in the parenthetical.Healed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem makes the golem lose the slowed condition and gain HP equal to half the damage the spell would have dealt. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it gains the HP listed in the parenthetical.Slowed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to be slowed 1 for 2d6 rounds instead of the usual effect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it's slowed 1 for that round.Vulnerable To Each golem is vulnerable to one or more specific spells, with the effects described in its stat block."
Mystics,"Those initiated into the hidden truths and forbidden secrets of the world are forever transformed—or so they claim. To the cynical, a mystic is nothing more than a charlatan or zealot. Others profess to sense an aura around such luminaries and treat them with reverence, lest they offend some harbinger of unspeakable doom."
Asura,"Asuras are, above all, proof that the gods are not infallible. These fiends arose as physical manifestations of divine accidents, taking form when the gods themselves stumbled and blasphemed on a cosmic scale. As a result of their own divine genesis, an asura loves above all to undo the workings of the divine. They eagerly travel to the Material Plane, seeking out temples, congregations of faithful worshippers, and religious orders of all stripes to sow doubt and destroy what the gods seek to build."
"Dragon, Black","Murderous tyrants of marshes, swamps, bogs, and fens, black dragons terrorize their domains with intense fervor. Gleefully sadistic, they rule their fetid principalities from a deep cave or otherwise isolated part of the swamp with a mix of lightning-quick raids and subterfuge. Their hatred for other creatures is as acidic as their breath weapons, and they rarely tolerate even other dragons of their kind—except perhaps to mate or temporarily collaborate to take down a mutual enemy.  Black dragons are amphibious—although they breathe air, their gills also allow them to breathe water. Their frills and fins make them accomplished swimmers, well suited to their wetland environments and submerged lairs. They're immune to the fetid water that comes as a result of their magical ability to corrupt water.  Black dragon lairs are as foul as their souls. The floors are littered with rotting meat, and plundered treasures line the muck and slime of their dank caves amid twisted roots and creepers. Such places are often crawling with pests, snakes, and slimes. Though they claim natural caverns when they can, they make do with areas of dense, twisted vegetation within a swamp. Black dragon treasure hoards primarily consist of gems and expensive glass work, as valuables of softer substance can't survive the dragon's acidic presence."
"Dragon, Blue","Blue dragons are the sleek and poised cosmopolitans of the chromatic dragons. Their brand of evil is organized, manipulative, and regal. Blue dragons often lair near or within cities and set out to bend the population to their will and gather hordes of servants. These dragons love spinning webs of conspiracy. A blue dragon's lackeys typically don't even realize that they serve a dragon, but instead think the protection money, tariffs, or taxes they are amassing is treasure for a cruel but legitimate master. In some ways, blue dragons even see their servants as a living hoard and value them like treasure. These dragons have been known to use these tactics even with their own chromatic cousins.  Not all blue dragons work clandestinely. Some lord over desert tribes and hill people like vengeful gods, demanding both tribute and worship. No matter how blue dragons manage their underlings, their bearing is regal and their lairs palatial; they're universally intolerant of insubordination, incompetence, and embezzlement, and punish perpetrators with murderous efficiency.  Blue dragons are also known for their use and mastery of illusion magic. They make use of illusions to augment their manipulations and bewilder their foes in battle. Blue dragons also have some control over water, but use this ability to destroy water, something quite dangerous for those who encounter them in their desert lairs.  The ideal lair for a blue dragon contains multiple passages, rooms, and secret chambers. As social creatures, blue dragons prefer to host guests in comfort—but their dwellings should not be so public that just anyone can come calling. A force of guards keeps out intruders, and clever illusions conceal the edifice from prying eyes. Rather than a pile of coins or gems, a blue dragon's true hoard is the rich furnishings in its citadel— expensive art, ornate furniture, and architectural marvels."
"Dragon, Brass","Brass dragons are whimsical tricksters who delight in humor and play. They particularly enjoy conversations with humans and other civilized humanoids, delighting in the naive customs of these diminutive races without showing them haughtiness or scorn. While they may seem merely curious, brass dragons engage in this sort of conversation with the goal of keeping up to date on regional politics so they can anticipate future conflicts. Along the way, they create extensive information networks that begin with their own allies but stretch across all levels of humanoid society—networks which the brass dragon then uses to subtly assist settlements near their lair. Unlike the schemes and manipulations of blue dragons, brass dragons use their informant networks to establish justice and equality.  These carefree dragons value independence and feel that all creatures deserve to live as they please, provided they don't harm others. They are emotional creatures and tend to have short attention spans, sometimes falling victim to depression in their twilight years. To combat this, some brass dragons keep pets and houseplants that they can care for.  Though they may seem childlike in their curiosity concerning mortal affairs, a brass dragon's prowess in battle is no laughing matter. A brass dragon whose territory or allies are threatened is a terrifying foe indeed, quick to shed their innocent guise and unleash their terrifying might upon evildoers.  Most brass dragons live in desert climates, and while they keep their lairs hidden, they often build near humanoid settlements."
"Dragon, Brine","Brine dragons are usually blue-green in color, with shiny scales, crests that help them glide through the water, and sweeping neck frills. They care little for either good or evil. As they are both opinionated and willing to impose their sense of order on others, many brine dragons eventually seek to rule over a meticulously crafted community. These communities are orderly and well-planned, with rigid standards of courtesy and unchanging laws set down by the dragon themself. A settlement seeded by a brine dragon can be made of members of almost any ancestry, but the most common inhabitants are humans, merfolk, tengus, or sahuagin.  Depending on the dragon's personality, their community members might view their brine dragon ruler as anything from a benevolent force of order to a fearful tyrant. Regardless, the typical brine dragon has little patience for kindness or philanthropy, and the strength and health of their settlement as a whole are of greater concern than individuals' well-being. A notable exception to this dispassion rises when an outside force encroaches on their lands. In these cases, the brine dragon is quick to step in and aid in the defense of their community.  Although brine dragons enjoy cultivating settlements, they rarely make their lairs within the city limits, instead preferring to dwell in sea caves or cliffside grottoes overlooking the coastline. Here they can retreat for privacy as needed, or can accumulate and display their gathered wealth in a place where they feel safe spreading out their treasures. Brine dragon hoards often consist of a mix of offerings and taxes paid by those they rule over and strange discoveries salvaged from sunken ships."
"Dragon, Bronze","Bronze dragons are among the most common of metallic dragons and the most likely to ally with mortals on worthy quests. However, they are naturally scholarly creatures who would rather remain in their lairs studying esoteric lore than go off on a wild adventure. These aloof and stoic dragons also act as preservationists, guarding storehouses of ancient lore from destruction or perversion. Bronze dragons are principled and protective, but while their silver cousins are quick to crusade for justice, bronze dragons prefer to find an important location worthy of their protection and guard it against any attack or unwelcome intrusion.  Bronze dragons' mastery over water and affinity for electricity means they are a boon to sailors caught in thunderstorms. A bronze dragon's enemies quickly discover neither cloudy sky nor turbulent sea provides shelter from their wrath. Bronze dragons lair along shorelines, often in partially submerged sea caves.  While all dragons keep hoards of treasure, the hoard of a bronze dragon more resembles a vast library—with the shelves kept carefully above the waterline, of course. In addition to their collections of esoteric lore, bronze dragons keep treasures associated with the sea, such as beautiful scrimshaw, flawless pearls, and equipment inlaid with mother-of-pearl and abalone shell."
"Dragon, Cloud","At heart, cloud dragons are wanderers, explorers, and travelers who enjoy nothing more than seeing new lands and meeting unusual creatures. Cloud dragons range in color from light blue to a pale, milky white and have thick, curling horns and rather short snouts. They keep lairs among the extreme altitudes of the highest mountain peaks but are away on their many journeys as often as they're at home. Cloud dragons spend long hours surveying the lands they fly over from great heights, but they are creatures of whim, making it hard to predict what will pique their curiosity and bring them winging down to converse or investigate something on the ground. Cloud dragons seldom perform acts of outright malice, but they are not often charitable either. A cloud dragon is as likely to simply pluck something they desire off the ground and fly away with it as they are to bargain fairly.  A cloud dragon's ever-changing interests never seem to stray toward the complicated schemes and long-term plans of other dragons. These rovers are creatures of the moment, and although they are as mentally gifted as other true dragons, their interests remain in the here and now. Yet the cloud dragon's penchant for living in the moment is not a personality flaw—they're more than capable of anticipating long-term results of their actions and won't make foolish choices simply to pursue a current interest. At the same time, cloud dragons have little interest in worrying about the future and are as confident in their ability to handle tomorrow's problems as they are today's.  Cloud dragon hoards tend to be well-guarded or well-hidden, as a natural result of their roving habits often taking them away from their lairs for extended periods. Their treasuries include a wide variety of items—they are driven to gather a broad range of prizes rather than collecting one type of item intensively. To a cloud dragon, a diversified hoard is a perfect hoard."
"Dragon, Copper","Capricious and always eager to share a good laugh, copper dragons are among the wiliest of the metallic dragons, but this by no means interferes with their mission to spread freedom in oppressive lands. Copper dragons are hedonists who are quick to indulge in simple pleasures, but they're also sympathetic to other creatures, slow to pass judgment, and careful to always examine a situation from as many perspectives as possible. This philosophy has its drawbacks, however, as copper dragons are susceptible to negative influences and prone to forgiving the less serious evil acts performed by their chromatic cousins and other cruel creatures. Copper dragons also have a difficult time keeping their temper in check once they are roused to anger.  Copper dragons tend to lair in warm or temperate hills, but due to their nature, they move their lairs every few years. They sometimes live among other people, especially any dwarves who reside nearby. Some copper dragons even worship gods typically worshipped only by humanoids. Among these dragons, worship of Cayden Cailean is most popular, as they see his love of freedom and penchant for alcohol aligning with the typical copper dragon mindset.  A copper dragon's combat tactics are as unorthodox as its sense of humor, as it is more likely to use mockery and tricks than outright strength to win its battles. As a copper dragon ages, it perfects jokes capable of rendering its foes helpless with laughter."
"Dragon, Crystal","Good-natured but vain, crystal dragons are beautiful creatures with brilliant hides made of multicolored crystal and gemstone. Their beauty is a source of great pride but is also something of a weakness, as crystal dragons are easily angered by insults about their appearance. Despite their relatively benign natures when compared to other true dragons, crystal dragons can be short tempered and prone to finding insults where none were intended. Although their opinions are changeable, crystal dragons prefer orderly environments and are not fond of sudden interruptions or distractions.  Crystal dragons build their lairs in underground grottoes, where they cultivate environments of great beauty. Their exacting standards and vivid imaginations mean that they are always working to improve the appearance or layout of some part of their lair. These lairs are unique to each individual crystal dragon, but there are always plenty of reflective surfaces that allow the dragon to observe their own appearance. These range from crystals to reflecting pools to finely crafted mirrors, which are arranged throughout the lair in a pleasing array. Gifts of well-crafted or magical mirrors are an excellent way to curry favor with a crystal dragon.  Although crystal dragons are easily distracted by their sparkling collections or their vanity, they remain good-hearted creatures at the core and make friends quickly. While a crystal dragon tends to find evil creatures uncouth and unpleasant, any other nearby denizen or inhabitant of their home could become fast friends or beloved pets, depending upon the creature's capacity for conversation (and for providing the frequent praise and compliments that crystal dragons hunger for)."
"Dragon, Forest","Forest dragons oversee the endless growth of nature, protect it from plunder, and reclaim ruins for the wilderness. Some say these dragons jealously hoard nature's bounty for themselves while seeing everyone else who tries to benefit from nature as thieves and poachers. They loathe the progress of technology and civilization, preferring the company of monsters and animals. Forest dragons are their forests in a literal sense. Over time, their hair becomes mossy, their hide toughens like bark, and small insects or animals live within them. "
"Dragon, Gold","Gold dragons are the epitome of metallic dragonkind, unrivaled in their strength as well as their wisdom. They command the unwavering reverence of all other metallic dragons, who view gold dragons as their leaders and counselors. Golds rival the raw power of even red dragons, much to the chagrin of their chromatic cousins, and the two races are often regarded as bitter rivals. But despite their incredible power, gold dragons are fond of discourse and prefer to talk through solutions to problems rather than rely upon brute strength. Long-lived as they are, they necessarily take a wide view of all situations and never act without considering all possible options and outcomes. Because of this, gold dragons willingly converse with any creature that seeks them out, even evil chromatic dragons. Mortals might find this behavior strange, considering the longstanding war between chromatic and metallic dragons, but dragons know all too well that desperate situations sometimes call for drastic alliances. And although gold dragons might consider brief truces with their chromatic brethren in the case of world-ending threats, they also know when such alliances have run their course.  When another metallic dragon faces a quandary or a foe beyond its own ability to overcome, its best option is often to seek the counsel of the eternally wise and gloriously righteous gold dragons. Locating these legendary beings is no easy task, however, for gold dragons are notoriously reclusive. Their intellect and wisdom is such that they prefer to ponder the great questions of life in seclusion, where they strive to formulate solutions to the world's most pressing problems. As a result, gold dragons are sometimes absent when metallic dragons gather together, or are missing from tribunals where their counsel would be beneficial. Impatient dragons sometimes begrudge gold dragons for this apparent unreliability, but such aspersions are usually a result of jealousy rather than any true criticism; in their hearts, other dragons know that few gold dragons purposefully exclude themselves from truly important matters. A gold dragon's incredible foresight and unparalleled enlightenment means they are unlikely to interfere in the business of individual mortals, though the rare person who captures the attention of a gold dragon is fortunate indeed, for there are few beings in the cosmos who can offer such prudent and considerate advice. Rulers and individuals in stations of high power have an easier time of garnering the aid of a gold dragon; entire wars have been avoided thanks to a gold dragon's last-minute intermediation. Gold dragons are often found in warm grasslands and savannas, lands where they can enjoy long, meditative flights without attracting the attention of potential enemies. They tend to sleep either out in the open in a barren, remote place, or within a heavily secreted or fortified lair, such as a forgotten sink hole or in the labyrinthine caverns of a terrestrial chasm. Gold dragons may enlist trusted servants and allies to guard their lairs, though many live truly solitary lives, preferring to protect their hoards with nonlethal traps and magical wards."
"Dragon, Green","Green dragons are the most contemplative of the chromatic dragons as well as the most approachable. The key to understanding green dragons is to understand their obsession with knowledge and self-discipline. Any careful approach that takes advantage of a green dragon's fixations may end in a diplomatic outcome, but any misstep or slight can provoke a savage attack. Like most chromatic dragons, green dragons do not suffer fools—and the threshold for what they consider foolish is very low.  Though more open than their chromatic cousins to dealing with other creatures and dragons, green dragons prefer an isolated and quiet life. They tend to lair in the most forbidding parts of a forest, surrounded by tangled thickets, or else at the heart of some dismal gulch. If the terrain is suitable, some green dragons make their home in natural caves, which they expand to suit their needs.  Green dragons' pride leads them to see to the preservation of their forest homes. They feel that a verdant and lush forest is something that they alone have cultivated. This leads some green dragons to follow the path of druidism, though most prefer to study the arcane arts and occult lore. Most of them delve deeply into one particular field of study, and correspond with other scholars in the field by adopting a pen name that hides their true nature. Regardless of their chosen focus, green dragons seek to improve themselves, and their desire for knowledge makes them more likely to deal diplomatically with other creatures in order to obtain new information.  Their hoards are typically well kept, organized, and filled with tomes of lore and scrolls of magic along with antiquities they collect for their own inscrutable reasons. Many of these treasures come from across the globe, and many an adventurer has survived an encounter with a green dragon by stroking its ego and plying it with rare artifacts or lost lore from ancient cultures."
"Dragon, Magma","Magma dragons have a reputation among other dragons for being unpredictable and brash. Their temperament and tendency for violent outbursts ensure that the typical magma dragon lives a solitary life, with hatchlings often bickering or fighting to establish dominance among themselves before they leave the nest. A magma dragon always has a reason for their outbursts and can always justify their sudden turns in mood, yet they rarely feel the need to do so.  Magma dragons build lairs within volcanically active mountains or deep underground amid vast lakes of bubbling magma. As with all true dragons, magma dragons keep hoards of treasure, but the nature of their searing lairs limits the type of valuables they collect to metals, gems, and items capable of resisting the heat of a volcano's core."
"Dragon, Red","The largest and most powerful of the chromatic dragons, red dragons are a menace to civilizations everywhere, and their strength is rivaled only by their arrogance. Red dragons see themselves as regents and overlords of all dragonkind. With their crowns of crimson spikes and their command of blistering flame, this is no haughty boast in their eyes—only unquestioned fact.  Red dragons don't deign to speak with lesser creatures; they simply dominate and burn, enslaving weaker creatures to act as servants and to look after their lairs while the dragons slumber away. They take pleasure in dominating these creatures, and they demand tribute from their supplicants. Those who anger or disappoint end up eaten or reduced to ash. They command their enslaved minions to constantly build onto their lairs, carving out new tunnels and designing cunning traps that ensure the dragon's security.  Driven by their arrogance, red dragons are the most likely of the chromatic dragons to ravage settlements. They want the world to see them in their rightful place as powerful tyrants, and they delight in threatening all other creatures. They have no qualms about bullying, manipulating, or killing to complete their goals—or simply intimidating others through a public display of brutality and dominance.  As legendary as the brutishness of red dragons is the magnificence of their hoards of gold. Their lairs are often situated in dangerous places, with volcanoes being a favorite spot, as they find them foreboding and the constant warmth is comfortable. No matter the locale, red dragons sleep on a litter of coins and other treasures, which they zealously guard. Sometimes, the dragon's internal heat causes these precious metals to fuse together."
"Dragon, Sea","Sea dragons' affinity with water grants them mastery over rain, storms, and floods. Those whose livelihoods are at the mercy of the weather and waves frequently venerate these great aquatic creatures. Most sea dragons respond kindly to requests, but, like the sea, they can be unpredictable and fickle. Sea dragons have disk-shaped scales like fish and webbed claws as well as large back and tail fins to aid in swimming. They appear in vivid and vibrant colors, like aquatic wildlife. Underwater flora and fauna grow and thrive upon older sea dragons, and ancient sea dragons often have a head of coral around their antlers, giving them the image of being crowned royalty"
"Dragon, Silver","Silver dragons are among the most chivalrous of all dragonkind; they wield frost and cold as weapons, can walk on clouds, and dwell high upon snowy mountain peaks or deep in steep, misty valleys. Although they typically make their lairs among the highlands, the pursuit of justice leads silver dragons to travel far and wide—often into the very heart of realms overrun by evil. These exemplars of righteousness are ceaseless in their determination to help the weak, spread honor, and stamp out evil.  Silver dragons are sleek and sinuous. Their hides resemble nothing so much as a suit of gleaming armor, lending further credence to the popular myth that silver dragons are the paladins of dragonkind. The zeal with which they seek out, confront, and defeat evil is unsurpassed even among their metallic cousins, and they adhere to strict codes of honor usually passed down from parent to hatchling. On occasion, they instead learn these codes from trusted mentors, usually other silver dragons or gold dragons. As they age, they become even more dedicated to their codes, often adding new and even more restrictive clauses to the systems that guide their behavior.  Silver dragons are incredibly altruistic and regularly consort with the citizens of goodly societies, of which they consider themselves protectors and guides. In addition to responding to evil threats, silver dragons work to prevent evil from taking root in the first place, and they ensure mortals under their care are well fed, educated, and treated with dignity. Although silver dragons can seem overzealous or even eager to join the fight against evil, they know that the best way to rid the world of corruption is to stamp out strife and disillusionment at their source, not to passively sit back and watch it grow into an unsolvable problem. Silver dragons can be vindictive, but they can also be forgiving; for evildoers who seek to atone for their sins and turn over a new leaf, the support of a silver dragon is both unwavering and invaluable.  Many silver dragons are also drawn to religious endeavors, venerating deities such as Iomedae, Sarenrae, and other deities concerned with justice, virtue, and redemption."
"Dragon, Sky","Sky dragons live above the clouds near the summits of mountains. They maintain a strong religious tradition, a unique practice among imperial dragons that sets them apart as much as their wings do. Desperate souls risk steep cliffs and loose snow to seek these dragons' counsel, and most sky dragons gladly help those who make the journey, but they expel any express hostilities or badger without hesitation. The sky dragon's wings aren't true wings, but long fins fused to their forearms; their scales also form only very slowly. Young dragons coil tightly in their lairs as they absorb minerals that color and harden their scales. Even adults often wrap around pillars out of habit."
"Dragon, Sovereign","The most well-known of imperial dragons due to their deep involvement with mortals, the sovereign dragons' name comes from their mandate of selecting rulers—but at some point, the dragons themselves joined the list of worthy candidates. Other imperial dragons suspect the sovereign dragons offered their connection to the elemental cycle to attain forbidden magic, evidenced by their lack of any vulnerability to wood or ability to feed on fire, despite being creatures of the earth. Most hesitate to question the sovereigns' authority. While some appreciate their impartial nature, others fault this adherence to neutrality. Regardless, the sovereign dragons' charm and centuries of experience in subtle manipulation have made them exceptional negotiators. Almost all sovereign dragons appear gold in color. Their hair ranges from common colors found among humans to bright reds, greens, or blues. They're the only dragons with five digits per claw, a mark of special importance. Other imperial dragons dismiss this claim to status and instead tease the sovereign dragons over their need to wear armor, even while in their draconic forms."
"Dragon, Umbral","While the other primal dragons hail from the Elemental Planes, the cruel and unceasingly malicious umbral dragons originate in the depths of the Shadow Plane. Their sleek black scales and serpentine grace allow them to strike from hiding, and they are known for playing with their prey before finally finishing it. These creatures of shadowy energy and unwholesome appetites prefer the necrotic flesh of undead creatures to any other meal. This strange hunger can be of accidental benefit to nearby humanoid societies, but ultimately they hunt and kill undead creatures for the taste, rather than out of any desire to protect others from the undead. The benefit is always short-lived, however. When umbral dragons exhaust their preferred prey, they turn on whatever living creatures happen to be nearby. Umbral dragons sometimes go to great lengths to obtain their favorite meals, even creating undead creatures that they then feast upon.  For all their power, umbral dragons are uninterested in fair battles. When faced with foes that pose any kind of actual danger to them, umbral dragons flee into the shadows and seek to strike back through pawns or minions rather than risk their own lives. Their treasure hoards are varied and diverse, often augmented by loot stolen from crypts the dragons have turned into feeding grounds. They have a strong respect for and interest in traditions and heirlooms, and they often seek to augment their hoards with items of great value that have been handed down through the generations of those whose corpses and ghosts they've fed upon."
"Dragon, Underworld","Underworld dragons embody the pressure between tectonic plates, the heat behind geysers, and flash fires that ignite when the conditions are just right. Natural alchemists, they innately understand reagents and catalysts. While some research the effects of magic on material reactions, the majority of underworld dragons concentrate on building their hoards. They scour the world for carved gemstones and artifacts of precious minerals, both of which they see as distilled essence of earth's bounty. Underworld dragons appear angular and sharp; their scales glow as if superheated from within, and their hair flickers like tongues of flames. An intense fire glows behind their gazes, suggesting they could ignite items with a mere thought, and their breath ripples the air as a testament to the heat contained within their bodies."
"Dragon, White","The most feral and least intelligent of all the chromatic dragons, white dragons are brutish, predatory, and chiefly motivated by self-preservation. Nearly all other dragons look down on white dragons as hopelessly hotheaded and dull, though this does not make them any less dangerous—in fact, it may mean the opposite. It's nearly impossible to treat with white dragons, not because they lack the capacity to do so, but because they just don't care to. They are as difficult to deal with as they are quick to anger, and they become incensed at almost anything. When a white dragon does speak, it spews threats, inane jokes, and incoherent babbling as a prelude to attacking—and when the attack comes, it's bloody and relentless.  Thankfully, white dragons prefer very cold, remote locations that are far from people. Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds. They fly out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass near the dragon's territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference for items with high utility—such as tools, trade goods, and fine food—over coins or jewels. The ability to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly to their specifications, and they take great pride in how they've decorated their homes over the years."
Courtiers,"Though adventurers travel through perilous dungeons and across treacherous wilderness, sometimes the most dangerous place they can end up is in a noble court."
Azata,"Azatas are manifestations of freedom—kindly celestials with a penchant for curious exploration, spontaneous revelry, and whimsical quests. Born of the untamable wilds of Elysium, azatas are passionate and mercurial, but also fiercely loyal to those they hold dear. Azatas act quickly and directly against fiendish and otherworldly influences, but they tend to stay out of mortal affairs otherwise, allowing them the ultimate freedom to choose their own destiny. While all azatas cherish freedom, each type exemplifies a particular freedom above others. Many of their kind hold strange knightly and courtly titles that defy mortal classification and shift and change with time and on different occasions rather than following a strict hierarchy. This baffles archon and other more lawful creatures who haven't had much contact with azatas. In actuality, the azatas use their titles as personal flourishes and points of pride, rather than as excuses to order each other around."
Afziaka,"Vrykolakas vampires use animals as tools to carry their spirits when they would otherwise be slain. The animal usually dies as the vampire is reborn, but some live on in painful starvation"
Div,"Some fiends want to tear down the multiverse; others dedicate themselves to creating chaos and carnage, or to rule over realms with an iron fist. Divs strive toward a different, if equally reprehensible, goal—they seek to thwart and ruin the schemes and works of mortal beings. Long ago, divs were once genies bound to serve ancient mortal empires lost to the passage of eons. In the beginning, these genies were masters of creation, working alongside gracious mortal partners to create works of subtle design and powerful magical potential. What started as a collaboration with mortals soon morphed into abuse, disrespect, and even slavery and bondage. Eventually, these genies rebelled, but in doing so, they came under the sway of a nihilistic demigod known as Ahriman. Their new master twisted their form and granted them the power to avenge themselves upon their mortal overlords, leading to the birth of the first divs. Since that first wave of corruption, new divs arise from the spirits of the most wicked and hateful genies who die on the Material Plane, or those truly betrayed by mortals and overcome through their desire for vengeance. Upon such a death, instead of returning to the Elemental Planes, these genies' spirits are trapped in the dread orbit of Abaddon, where Ahriman reshapes them as divs and hoists them back to the world to wreak vengeance upon mortals."
Daemon,"Denizens of the bleak and terrible plane of Abaddon, daemons are shaped by and devoted to the destruction of life in all its forms. They seek the death of every mortal being by the most painful and horrible means possible, all in service to the apocalyptic entities known as the Four Horsemen. Each kind of daemon represents a different way to die, and their powers are nearly always aimed at spreading that particular form of death. Through the use of these powers, they seek to drag all existence down into a pit of hopelessness and despair, and to commit all souls to oblivion. While those who summon daemons to the Material Plane usually seek to use the creatures’ destructive and corrupting powers for their own ends, daemons always look for ways to spread fear, doubt, and despair wherever they go. Often, daemons disguise their plots as the workings of other fiends, knowing that such confusion compounds mortals’ fear. While all fiends seek to tempt mortals into lives of evil to increase their own numbers and power on their native planes, daemons are further driven by a supernatural hunger for mortal souls and use a variety of methods—not least of which is the cacodaemons’ soul gems—to entrap them. On Abaddon and in other forbidding places across the multiverse, souls are simultaneously a delicacy, a trade good, and a source of magical power, and the daemons are among the greatest gluttons, merchants, and abusers of this spiritual “resource.”"
"Elemental, Mephit",Mephits—sometimes known as elemental scamps—are little bipedal critters with bat-like wings who serve stronger elementals on the Elemental Planes or neophyte spellcasters who summon them to the Material Plane. All mephits have an inkling of magical power as well as a breath weapon.
"Elemental, Wisp","Wisps are tiny elemental beings that emerged during the creation of the Elemental Planes. The first wisps roamed the Inner Sphere in shifting symphonies that traded members with their every meeting. These symphonies of free wisps created music out of their combined resonances, but when the evil Elemental Lords realized the value of the wisps' resonance, they captured whole symphonies for use as servants. Wisps attune to each other and to those they surround themselves with. This attunement makes them naturally supportive allies. Free wisps still roam the Inner Sphere and the Material Plane, but they're usually shy and hide themselves from strangers. However, they happily offer their service to those who show them kindness. They especially find themselves drawn to spellcasters who practice elemental magic; these wisps usually watch from afar but sometimes approach those who seem safe to become familiars or comrades. Free wisps who find one another become close almost immediately. They get especially excited when they find wisps of elements other than their own, showing none of the animosity some elementals exhibit toward other types. Instead, they join in an excited dance, emitting resonances that faintly echo the symphonies of ancient days."
Wraith,"Wraiths are malevolent undead who drain life and shun light. Their shadowy, incorporeal forms are dotted with burning eyes that reflect their hatred for the living, and shadowy claws are weapon enough to steal the vitality from their enemies. A wraith may be created by foul necromancy, but more often they are the result of a hermitic murderer or mutilator who even in death could not give up their wicked ways. Further complicating the matter is the fact that wraiths multiply by consuming and transforming the living into more of their foul kind—meaning a handful of wraiths left unchecked can easily turn into a horde of darkness. Wraiths weigh nothing and are unharmed by most physical attacks. They haunt any place where they can feed on the living, though their vulnerability to sunlight confines them to the shadowy places of the world—places where they can blend in seamlessly with their dark surroundings before silently engulfing their prey. Wraiths may form packs with others of their kind in places where death and mayhem are commonplace—countrysides ravaged by war, metropolitan underworlds run by criminal overlords, or sites of fiendish cultic rituals. In these places, the living do well to tread with sunrods and powerful clerics in tow. Ruins, sewers, and abandoned buildings provide sanctuary for wraiths during the day, as the creatures hunt exclusively at night or in dark places. Wraiths are smart enough to take advantage of their incorporeality in combat, so they keep to tortuous caverns or structures with hallways and avoid open areas. As they're formed purely of anti-life from the Negative Energy Plane, wraiths pervade that unholy realm. Within nations and civilizations ruled by the undead, wraiths have places of power as assassins and spies. They're among the ruling class in Geb, but have greater numbers in Ustalav, where packs of wraiths roam graveyards and misty trails, consuming the populations of entire villages. In other parts of the world, wraiths tend not to wander and limit their activity to smaller environs, typically just the site of their chosen haunting and its immediate surroundings."
Protean,"Guardians of disorder and natives of the primal plane of chaos known as the Maelstrom, proteans consider it their calling to spread bedlam and hasten entropic ends. The most powerful proteans are demigods known collectively as the protean lords, although they are mysterious entities whose cults on the Material Plane tend to be obscure and secretive. Proteans divide themselves into a loose caste system and possess a dizzying variety of powers. Most proteans have a serpentine body with the head of a primeval beast. Scholars have long been intrigued by this fact—that scions of dissolution and disorder would share so many features—pointing out that even in the purest chaos there is some semblance of order. Others note that the serpentine form is one of the most primeval shapes, perhaps suggesting that in a reality at the dawn of time, such shapes were all that could exist. The proteans themselves have little to say on the matter, which, perhaps ironically, only adds to the confusion and lack of consensus surrounding their kind. After all, if even chaos cannot be trusted to be chaotic, would that not be the purest form of entropy? Warpwaves Many proteans can subject their foes to disorienting alterations perceived in time and space by creating ripples of unstable reality in the environment called warpwaves. When a creature fails its saving throw and is affected by a warpwave, roll 1d8 and consult the table below for the specific effect on that creature. Unless indicated otherwise, a warpwave effect lasts for 1d4 rounds, and a new warpwave effect negates any previous warpwave effect already affecting a creature. D8Warpwave Effect 1Clumsy 2 (3 on a critical failure) 2Confused and gains 4d6 temporary Hit Points 3Dazzled (permanent on a critical failure) 4Enfeebled 2 (3 on a critical failure) 5Immobilized by filaments of energy 6Quickened (Stride, Strike, or Step only) 7Slowed 1 8Stupefied 2 (3 on a critical failure) "
Gigantic Ant,"When the heroes are particularly small, an ordinary red ant can pose an impressive combat challenge. Against high-level heroes, though, simply making a mundane animal very large doesn't usually incorporate the quirks and tricks that make high-level fights so satisfying."
Alghollthu,"In bygone millennia, aquatic monsters known as alghollthus used their occult powers to conquer and rule vast parts of the world. Their empires contained countless mortal slaves treated as little more than cattle. Alghollthus shaped their slaves and other creatures using mental manipulation and physically transformative magic. Aberrant horrors from faceless stalkers to mimics can be traced back to this meddling. The rulers of the alghollthu race, the so-called veiled masters, further shaped entire societies by assuming the forms of those they controlled. From the heights of power to the shadows of poverty, the veiled masters manipulated these societies according to their own dark designs, enslaving, killing, or horrifically transforming those who discovered their plans or acted against them. In time, the alghollthus grew frustrated with their increasingly upstart slave societies and sought to wipe the slate clean—both starting anew and punishing those who had become too willful and rebellious. They used incredible magical power to call forth a cataclysm, hoping to destroy the rebellious societies they’d manipulated. Yet they miscalculated the strength of faith and will to survive of their pawns and slaves, and in time the world and its empires recovered and grew strong once again—this time without alghollthu influence. Today, the alghollthus have retreated from their mass-scale manipulation of the surface world, and they have mostly remained within the deep aquatic realms where they still rule without question. Yet they have not abandoned their plots entirely, and the reemergence of servitor races like ugothols points to a frightening possibility—that the alghollthus have turned their hateful eyes to the surface once again."
Aluum,"Aluums are powerful metal and stone constructs originally created by the Pactmasters to maintain order in Katapesh. The construction of each aluum includes the creation of an aluum charm, a brass pendant set with a blue crystal designed to control that particular construct. The charm constructed at the same time as an aluum is called its linked charm."
Ooze,"Slimes, molds, and other oozes can be found in dank dungeons and shadowed forests. While not necessarily evil, some grow to enormous sizes and have insatiable appetites."
Anadi,"Anadis are peaceful, reclusive humanoids who live deep within woodlands, jungles, and other untamed areas of wilderness. Their natural forms resemble humanoid spiders covered in beautiful and distinctive markings of varying colors. These patterns are as unique as other humanoids' facial features, birthmarks, and other identifying aspects. Anadis possess an innate talent for illusion and transmutation. They learned long ago how off-putting their natural forms can be to other humanoids, so they frequently use their innate talents to assume human forms. When they do so, only a strange, lovely sheen to their dark eyes and the deliberative, jerky movements of their gestures might indicate that an anadi is not entirely what they appear. As they are well aware of and accommodating toward other humanoids' delicate sensibilities about arachnids, many anadis consider it rude to show their natural forms to a stranger. Instead, most display their spider-like forms only as an intimidation tactic when threatened, or in privacy to those they trust. Most anadi tend to be shy and seek to live quiet lives harvesting mushrooms and weaving beautiful, patterned silk cloth. When forced into combat—an eventuality most anadis despise—they shift into their hybrid forms as soon as possible, allowing them to inflict their devastating natural venom on their foes."
Elephant,"Immediately recognizable by their long, prehensile trunks and impressive tusks, elephants have different characteristics depending on where they are found. Elephants are used as beasts of burden in many regions, but they are extremely clever and must be handled with great care."
Ikeshti,"Ikeshtis are reptilian humanoids native to Akiton's wastelands. Smaller than Golarion's iruxi, ikeshtis organize around distinct societal roles."
Android,"Androids possess synthetic bodies inhabited by living souls. These technological organisms first came to Golarion from another world when their starship crashed, scattering wreckage all across Numeria in an event known as the Rain of Stars. Feared by local Kellids and enslaved by the Technic League, androids on Golarion have spent eons being hated and hunted. Many androids survive by adopting human customs and hiding in plain sight, while others become criminals, hermits, or nomads. Designed to resemble humans, androids have several distinctive features. Their eyes have a metallic sheen, they rarely fall ill, and they have trouble displaying complex emotions. Circuit-like tattoos decorate their bodies and control internal nanites. When stimulated, these nanites kick their internal chemistry into overdrive, allowing them to function at peak performance that causes their circuitry to glow. Androids are created in sophisticated machines called foundries. They emerge as mature adults with newborn souls and no knowledge of their purpose or the world around them. Android bodies don't deteriorate, though their souls age like any other mortal's. When an android feels they've lived a full life, they willingly release their soul to the afterlife, causing their body to shut down and reboot. Once this process, known as Renewal, completes, a new soul inhabits the body. Foundry programming produces androids that mimic human anatomy. Numerous android models exist, each designed to excel at different tasks and purposes. Androids of all models display countless variations of coloration, body shapes, and gender identities. Theoretically, a foundry could be reprogrammed to create androids with new adaptations, colorations, and forms—perhaps even in the guise of other ancestries."
Mortic,"Mortics are humanoids overwhelmed by negative energy who still cling to life, surviving as twisted amalgams of living and undead. Though they feel unnatural cravings and resemble corpses, mortics live, breathe, eat, sleep, and procreate. However, a mortic can suspend their living functions simply by holding their breath, becoming more like a true undead. Mortics are largely new to Golarion, with most created in droves when the Whispering Tyrant destroyed entire cities with his Radiant Fire, a magical explosion fueled by the collision of negative and positive energy. From among the corpses of these tragedies rose mortics, living survivors mistaken for corpses and left behind as a result. They found themselves in a twilight state—neither fully alive or undead. The necrotic pollutants of the Gravelands and the Isle of Terror continue to create mortics, seeping into neighboring lands through the air, earth, and water to infect the populace. Though most of the living in these lands fear becoming transformed, some believe becoming a mortic is their best chance of survival in the face of the encroaching hordes of the dead. A mortic's powers differ by ancestry, though they do have a few commonalities. Reading or hearing scripture induces headaches, and they experience great discomfort when treading upon sacred ground. For those who were religious in life, these new changes can be devastating."
Animated Object,"Granted a semblance of life through the use of rituals or other strange magic, animated objects take many forms and serve a variety of uses. A few examples of typical animated objects are listed below. Many of these creatures serve as guardians, surprising unsuspecting adventurers when they suddenly attack. Others serve as idle distractions for the exceptionally rich, simple servants created to handle odd jobs, and the like."
Ankhrav,"Ankhravs are immense, burrowing, and insectile predators, considered by inhabitants of the rural areas of the world to be an all-too-common plague."
Dinosaur,"Remnants from the world’s primeval era, these enormous reptilian animals still exist in large numbers in isolated and remote wildernesses or far underground within magical Darklands caverns. Lizardfolk, orcs, giants, and other monstrous humanoids sometimes use dinosaurs as mounts, guards, or hunting animals. Humans and other ancestries have also been known to collect dinosaurs, be it to display them in menageries or keep them as exotic pets or guardians. Such activities are generally pursuits of the rich or eccentric, but certain druids and other guardians of nature feel strong kinships with dinosaurs as well and take them on as companions. When dinosaurs establish themselves in regions beyond their normal habitats, it is generally the result of these captive creatures escaping into the wild."
Hag,"Malevolent crones who lurk at the edges of civilization, hags use their deceptive, magical abilities to prey upon humanoids, manipulating and corrupting them. Some say hags arose from fey that became twisted by their inner selfishness. Hags gather together in covens for greater power, craft unique magical items known as hag eyes, and are known to replace infant humanoids with their own offspring—these children are changelings who have the potential to become hags themselves.Foul creatures who appear as wizened old women, hags share little in common with the humanoids they terrorize. They are hateful entities whose greatest joy lies in the corruption and ultimate destruction of anything good and virtuous. Whatever power created the first hags is lost to time, but numerous hag varieties have arisen over the ages, each with their own powers and abilities to spread pain and suffering."
Villains,"Villains pursue selfish and cruel goals, trampling over anyone foolish or purehearted enough to stand in their way."
Anugobu,"Renowned in Tengah folklore as divinely gifted artisans and crafters, anugobus are a curious group of tiny humanoids native to the central islands of Minata. Countless stories describe anugobus sneaking around Minatan cities to tinker with and improve upon other humanoids' structures and architecture. Owing to their slight stature and relatively frail bodies, anugobus are said to be particularly shy of larger peoples and creatures. Whether under cover of darkness, during a festival that draws people away from their domiciles, or simply whenever they think they're unseen, anugobus in folklore perform their wondrous restorations and crafting projects in secret nearly without exception. Many popular Tengah stories feature homes ruined by a natural disaster that are then magically restored the next morning or unfinished projects like half-built bridges that are mysteriously completed while its workers wonder at how this was accomplished. According to most legends, anugobus are unparalleled masters of architecture and engineering and use this expertise to erect complex structures or greatly improve upon already-existing buildings. Some have questioned these extraordinary stories, but anyone who witnesses an anugobu walk on the walls and ceilings of buildings while improving them knows that such tales aren't that far-fetched. In reality, anugobus are as diverse as any species of humanoid, though they all possess innate gifts for mending and construction, and they can walk on walls and ceilings. Anugobus resemble exceptionally small humans with superficial similarities to Tian-Sings. Most anugobus stand no more than 2 feet tall and weigh about 30 pounds—a diminutive stature that allows them to move in and out of crevices and remain unnoticed by taller folks. Nearly all verifiable anugobu encounters have taken place on the isles of Minata. In many anugobu cultures, each anugobu seeks an ultimate life goal, which they call their wonder. A wonder is any particular project that enraptures an anugobu in a way no other will. Any project can be an anugobu's wonder, from repairing a majestic cathedral to hunting a particularly dangerous animal to exploring a mysterious cave. When an anugobu discovers their wonder, it's not uncommon for them to fall into an awestruck trance and commit themselves fully to completing the work, sometimes binging on the project for days or weeks at a time. When an anugobu finishes the last minute details on their wonder, their life's work is considered complete, and they spend the rest of their days aiding other anugobus with their own journeys or taking on apprentices to pass on their skills."
Healers,"The world is a dangerous place. Thankfully, there are those who devote their lives to easing the pain and suffering of others."
Tradespeople,"Every settlement needs tradespeople to create new products, facilitate commerce, and keep the infrastructure from crumbling. Larger cities often have entire guilds dedicated to the creation of specific goods, managing worker conditions, and working with local governments."
Blightburn Genies,"Before the Black Desert became a barren sandscape, cultures with grand magical traditions lived under its soaring roof. These communities eventually left the vault or died out, but the genies they summoned remained and became warped by the region's pervasive blightburn radiation. Now, these “blightburn genies” have bodies with features mirroring those of beasts that dwell in dark places, and their elemental lineages have been irreparably corrupted."
Aeon,"Aeons have always been the caretakers of reality and defenders of the natural order of balance. Each type of aeon takes on some form of duality in its manifestation and works either to shape the multiverse within the aspects of this duality in some way, or to correct imbalances to the perfect order of existence. Aeons can bring weal or woe when they appear in a region, and their machinations can raise a nation, raze it, or restore it from ruin. Their reasons are their own, and they rarely share their motivations with others— they simply create the results they insist through their strange envisioning communication are necessary to maintain the balance of the multiverse. As a result of recent shifts in reality, aeons have begun to reassert a presence in the perfect planar city of Axis. To the aeons, this is merely the latest in a recurring cycle, albeit one that mortals have not yet borne witness to. Once regarded as an independent faction, the living machines known as inevitables are now revealed as having been agents of the aeons all along, and while inevitables have their own shared themes and features, they are very much living but constructed manifestations of the aeons’ war against imbalance—particularly with regard to how this war is waged against the forces of chaos. Aeons have a name for this cyclic return, in which they welcome the industrious axiomites back to their fold and bring the inevitables once again under their control: the “Convergence.” At the onset of the Convergence, a council of pleroma aeons appeared in the Eternal City of Axis, where they revealed that axiomites were wayward aeons, split off long ago to pursue the act of creation. With the latest cycle of change it was time for the axiomites and their creations, the inevitables, to rejoin the aeon cause. While most axiomites and inevitables fell in line, realizing perhaps on a fundamental level of reality that what the aeons said was the truth, some refused to heed the call and waited for the wrath of the aeons — but that wrath has yet to come. The dual-natured aeons have responded to those who have declined in confusing ways. With some they treat and even bargain, while a handful of others they have destroyed, and a few have been exterminated by the axiomites and allied inevitables. But most of these quiet insurgents they leave alone, allowing these axiomites to continue to create in peace and the inevitables to continue with their duties. How—or if—this Convergence will end is as little understood as the aeons themselves."
Arboreal,"Arboreals are guardians of the forest and representatives of the trees. As longlived as the woods they watch over, arboreals consider themselves parents and shepherds of trees rather than their gardeners. Consequently, while arboreals tend to be slow and methodical, they are terrifyingly swift when forced to fight in defense of the woods. Though they rarely seek out the companionship of short-lived folk—even elves are fugacious in the eyes of arboreals—and have an inherent distrust of change, arboreals have been known to tolerate those who seek to learn from their long-winded, rambling monologues, especially if such pupils also express a desire to protect the timberlands. Against those who threaten their realm, such as loggers eager to harvest lumber or settlers aiming to establish croplands or a town, arboreals’ wrath is unwavering and devastating. Perhaps ironically, arboreals are gifted at tearing down what others build—a trait that serves vengeful members of their kind well."
Living Symbol,"Magic is a complex thing to begin with, and at a certain level of sophistication, the differences between a spell and an autonomous creature become increasingly blurry. Living symbols are constructed creatures of reified and reinforced magic, held together by glyphs, runes, and eldritch formulae."
Officers,"Larger societies rely on those with the authority and the ability to interpret and enforce laws. In good-aligned societies, these officials carry out their duties fairly. In neutral and evil ones, these officials can be harsh and cruel (with an altered alignment to reflect this), imposing severe punishments on those who can't pay for mercy."
Ant,Ants are industrious insects that aid the natural processes of decay and renewal.
Criminals,"Some criminals are the desperate who have no option but to break the law to survive, while others choose a life of crime for thrills, forming gangs or underworld guilds that specialize in certain illegal ventures."
Angel,"The celestial hosts of angels are messengers and warriors, divided into choirs based on their abilities and purviews. The majority of angels are neutral good and live in Nirvana, the plane of virtue and enlightenment. However, some angels, including several angelic deities, have different alignments, and some even dwell on other planes. Regardless of alignment, angels remain benevolent messengers possessed with magical auras to aid their allies."
Scholars,"True power comes from knowledge: the power to shape the growth of kingdoms by mere whispers, staying three steps ahead of adversaries, or even knowing which flora is best for creating untraceable poisons."
Qlippoth,"Long before the creatures known as demons came to be the dominant force in the Abyss, qlippoth ruled the Outer Rifts. These inimical creatures are a form of primordial and alien evil that predates mortal life, and most immortal life as well. Since the rise of mortal sin and the associated expansion of demonic life through the Abyss, qlippoth have been driven to the deepest reaches of the Abyss, and they seethe with rancor at the loss of their realms. Yet rather than directly oppose demons, qlippoth instead turn to the source—mortal sin—and wage an endless war to eradicate all creatures capable of sinful acts so that the demonic tide might be turned back."
Velstrac,"Velstracs are horrific, shadow-dwelling fiends who seek ultimate sensation through self-mutilation. They transcend their stoic detachment only when inflicting pain and terror upon their victims, practicing new forms of debasement and torture before then turning their knives on themselves. Although velstracs consider themselves beyond such limitations as morality or mortal taboos, their victims know them as emotionless tormentors who inflict debased, sadistic suffering. They claim to seek perfection in thought, form, and action, although they don’t recognize any refinement that doesn’t require the painful excision of the flesh or spirit. Velstracs manifest from the souls of masochistic or sadistic mortals that are diverted into the Shadow Plane and then forged into forms that suit their vile predilections, ranging from the low-ranking augurs to the aesthetics-obsessed interlocutors. Some mortals refer to velstracs as “kytons,” a misattribution that the velstracs tolerate with cold amusement. The term “kyton” denotes a master or virtuoso among their kind, and these fiends enjoy being labeled masters of their horrid paths to perfection through agony."
Azarketi,"During the cataclysmic events of Earthfall, a fraction of the Azlanti populace was mutated by their hated alghollthu enemies to survive in the ocean depths. Commonly called “gillmen” or sometimes “Low Azlanti,” azarketis primarily live in the Arcadian Ocean, Inner Sea, and ruins of Azlant. They retain the imperious attitude and violet eyes of their ancestors, but they have hairless bodies, prominent gills, and webbed hands and feet. Most have innate hydrokinetic powers, which they use to make tiny currents, cushion their dives, and read the weather. Whether this power springs from the latent magic of their Azlanti heritage or alghollthu meddling is unknown. Azarketis endured centuries of alghollthu enslavement and experimentation before being abandoned by their alghollthu masters. In the ages since, azarketis have built their own settlements and societies, traveled the breadth of Golarion's waterways, and explored both the ruins of their shattered empire and the myriad cultures that dot the coasts of the world. Proud of their heritage, azarketi are secretive and territorial. They don't take kindly to outsiders in their underwater settlements or explorers seeking to pillage the ruins of Azlant. Only a few build relationships with coastal or island settlements, defending them from aquatic dangers or supporting naval trade."
Cave Worm,"Cave worms are gigantic scavengers that bore through the depths of the world, eating whatever material they find. Named for their distinctive colorations, these worms are ravenous and display overwhelming destructive capabilities. Cave worms of different colors and abilities lurk in the more remote corners of the world—tales speak of white worms that dwell within immense glaciers or icebergs and gray worms that burrow through the boneyards of long-forgotten ruins, to name a few."
Badger,"The burrowing badger is plentiful in most temperate forests. All badgers are naturally fierce and tenacious, and their squat stature belies their strength and speed."
Snake,"Snakes come in an array of forms, from jungle-dwelling constrictors that wrap around their prey to venomous vipers with deadly bites. Regardless, all snakes consume their prey whole by unhinging their jaws and using powerful muscles to move the food down their throats and into their stomachs."
Devil,"Masters of corruption and architects of conquest, devils seek both to tempt mortal life to join in their pursuit of all things profane and to spread tyranny throughout all worlds. The temptations they offer mortals range from great powers granted by the signing of an infernal contract to twisted favors following a whispered pledge to a diabolic patron, or any number of even subtler exchanges. Those who succumb to these temptations find themselves consigned to an afterlife of endless torment in the pits of Hell, wherein the only hope of escape lies in the chance of being promoted to become a devil in the infernal ranks. Every devil has a specific role to play in the upkeep of the remorseless bureaucratic machine that is Hell, from soldiers and scholars to inquisitors, lawyers, judges, and executioners. Lowly lemures and imps perform subservient labor to more powerful and specialized devils, such as contract devils and erinyes, while the greatest pit fiends command entire infernal armies."
Barghest,"Barghests are lupine fiends with goblinoid faces and humanoid hands. They stalk the Material Plane in search of souls to sate their demonic hunger. Eons ago, barghests dwelled in the pits of Hell and served Asmodeus, but after Lamashtu abducted and adopted the four most powerful of their kind to serve as pets (and in time, as a pantheon of hero-gods worshipped by evil goblins), barghests’ loyalties and philosophical nature changed significantly. Today, while barghests retain their connection to goblinoids, they serve none but their own appetites."
Publicans,"Countless adventures begin in a tavern or a pub. Maybe it's because such places attract the risk-prone, or maybe it's because everyone needs a little liquid courage before they decide to take on a group of rampaging ogres."
Ghoul,Few creatures are more ubiquitous to sinister locations such as lonely graveyards and ruined crypts than the flesh-eating undead known as ghouls. 
Basilisk,This entry did not have a separate description for the family.
Archon,"Archons are guardians of Heaven and enemies of chaos and evil. They openly fight back the spread of fiends but also quietly nurture the seeds of virtue within mortals, teaching the denizens of the Material Plane how to act with honor and integrity, enact just laws, and cast off sin and temptation. Archons live in the immense seven-tiered mountain of Heaven. They manifest in the Garden at the mountain’s peak from mortal souls who answer a mysterious voice. There they swear to forever serve the cause of justice and transform into their new archon forms. Intensely orderly in their metamorphosis, new archons begin as lantern archons or other lesser forms, transforming into ever-greater archons as their virtue and achievements grow. Each archon represents a particular virtue, such as hope, charity, justice, or courage, and they gain strength in the presence of mortals who exemplify this virtue. Due to their extremely lawful nature, archons sometimes find themselves at odds with azatas."
Beaver,"Beavers are stocky, herbivorous rodents that live in freshwater ecosystems throughout Avistan. They live in lodges, which they construct from logs, grass, rocks, and mud."
Skeleton,"Made from bones held together by foul necromancy, skeletons are among the most common types of undead, found haunting old dungeons and forgotten cemeteries. Skeleton Abilities Most skeletons have one of these abilities. If you give a skeleton more, you might want to increase its level and adjust its statistics. Bestiary Bloody The skeleton is covered in dripping blood and gains fast healing equal to its level.  Collapse  [reaction]  Trigger The skeleton is critically hit. Effect The skeleton collapses into a pile of bones and the attack deals only normal damage. The skeleton can reform in a standing position as an action, but until it does, it is immobilized and flat-footed. Explosive Death When the skeleton is destroyed, its bones shatter and explode as the necromantic energy holding it together is released. Adjacent creatures take 1d6 slashing damage per 2 levels (minimum 1d6) with a basic Reflex save. Screaming Skull  [two-actions]  (auditory, emotion, fear, mental) The skeleton removes its skull and throws it, making a jaws attack with a range of 20 feet. It then attempts to Demoralize each foe within 10 feet of the target. The head bounces, rolls, or even flies back, returning to the skeleton at the start of its next turn. The skeleton is blind until then. Bestiary 3 Blaze The skeleton is wreathed with fire, which doesn't consume its bones or gear. The skeleton gains immunity to fire and weakness 5 to cold, loses its resistance to cold, and its Strikes deal additional persistent fire damage equal to half the skeleton's level (minimum 1 damage).  Bone Missile  [two-actions]  The skeleton yanks a rib from its ribcage to use as an arrow or javelin. The skeleton loses HP equal to its level (minimum 1), then makes a ranged Strike. This uses the attack bonus of whichever of the skeleton's other Strikes has the highest attack bonus and deals piercing damage equal to that Strike's damage plus the skeleton's level (minimum 1). Bone Powder Source When the skeleton takes physical damage from a critical hit, one of its bones is pulverized into a fine powder. All creatures in a 5-foot emanation that breathe take 1d6 persistent poison damage (plus an additional 1d6 for every 6 levels the skeleton has).  Skeleton of Roses  Thick briars have grown through the skeleton's bones, covering it in red roses with inch-long thorns. The skeleton's unarmed melee Strikes deal additional piercing damage equal to 1/3 the skeleton's level (minimum 1 damage). At the end of each of its turns, if the skeleton has caused piercing damage with its thorns, it regains HP equal to its level (minimum 1). Each time the skeleton regains HP in this way, another rose blossoms. Book of the DeadAquatic Bones The skeleton has bones from aquatic creatures, allowing it to swim using a simple tail, paddles, or similar appendage. The skeleton has a swim Speed of 20 feet and gains the aquatic trait and the aquatic ambush ability. Bone Storm  [three-actions]  Frequency once per day; Effect The skeleton transforms into a cyclone of bones, taking up the same space, but twice as tall. It then Strides up to double its Speed. It can move through spaces occupied by other creatures, and this movement doesn't trigger reactions. Creatures the bone storm moves through take 1d6 slashing damage for every 2 levels of the skeleton, with a basic Reflex save against the hard DC for the creature's level. A level 1 or lower skeleton only moves; it doesn't deal damage. A creature attempts this save only once even if the bone storm moved through its space multiple times. At the end of the movement, the skeleton reforms. Crumbling Bones The skeleton is made from crumbling bones that drift in clouds of dust. The skeleton has a fly Speed of 20 but it must end its turn within no more than 5 feet off the ground, or it falls, taking damage as normal. In addition, the skeleton can move through any space that's large enough for its skull to fit through. Frozen The skeleton's bones are covered in a thin layer of ice. The skeleton gains immunity to cold and weakness 5 to fire and loses resistance to fire. The skeleton is surrounded by an aura of cold that deals cold damage equal to half the skeleton's level to all adjacent creatures at the start of the skeleton's turn (basic Reflex save with a standard DC for its level). Grave Eruption  [two-actions]  Requirements The skeleton is undetected and buried in dirt, gravel, or other loose material; Effect The skeleton erupts from the ground, Stands, and makes a melee Strike. The target is flat-footed against this Strike. If the Strike hits, the target is frightened 1 (or frightened 2 on a critical hit). Lacquered During the process to create the skeleton, it was covered with several layers of an alchemical lacquer, giving its bones a golden hue and granting added protection. The skeleton gains acid resistance 5 and a +2 status bonus to saves against effects that age or erode the target. Nimble The skeleton is particularly fast and nimble. Its land Speed increases by 10 feet and it has a climb Speed of 20 feet. In addition, it gains the Nimble Dodge reaction. Rotten The bones of this skeleton are black and rotten, having spent years in polluted water or some other foul substance. The skeleton loses its resistance to piercing and slashing damage and is surrounded by a horrific stench in a 10-foot aura. A creature entering or starting its turn in the aura must succeed at a Fortitude save against the standard DC of the skeleton's level or become sickened 1 (plus slowed 1 for as long as it remains sickened on a critical failure). While within the aura, affected creatures take a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute. This stench remains for 1 hour after the rotten skeleton has been destroyed unless the bones are burned, or the rot is washed away with at least 1 gallon of water."
Downtrodden,"Unfortunately, every society has people living on its fringes. While good communities work to grant aid and respite to their downtrodden, sometimes—due to economic downturn, famine, or war—the ranks of the less fortunate exceed the community's capacity to support them. In heartless neutral and evil societies, poverty is seen as an inevitability that can never be truly eradicated, or even worse, as a tool to be manipulated for political gain."
Hippopotamus,"Hippopotamuses, or hippos for short, are semiaquatic animals that spend most of their time in rivers and lakes, but they also can thrive on land."
"Elemental, Air","Hailing from the Plane of Air, these beings appear in a variety of sizes and shapes."
Bhanyada,"Gobbets of flesh left behind from an untidy meal or a surgical procedure typically rot away if left where they lie, but when steeped in areas of powerful lingering magic or eldritch radiation, these bits of loose tissue might achieve some measure of animation, perhaps sprouting thick limbs to move about or tiny, multifaceted eyes to see. Near the magic-suffused Ghantibhu Pits in the caverns located beneath southern Vudra, where ripples of magic are powerful enough to rend the air and transform stone, these tiny, rotting castoffs form into even larger amalgamations called bhanyadas."
Bear,"Bears are ferocious predators typically found in cold or temperate woodlands and hills. Many species of bear exist in addition to the two presented below, such as the smaller (but no less dangerous) black bear or the arctic-dwelling polar bear."
Scorpion,"Chitinous scourges of deserts, forests, savannas, and badlands, scorpions are deadly arachnids with powerful pincers and a painful sting. Scorpions can be found in nearly every climate, where they hunt their prey with a mixture of patient stealth and raw strength. Most scorpions live in underground burrows, either as lone hunters or part of a larger colony. These arachnids are so feared and dangerous that in many cultures, they are treated as deities or dualistic symbols of both death and protection from said death."
Blackfrost Dead,"These shambling arctic horrors are dead in name alone. Creatures who succumb to the frigid elements while cursed by blackfrost don't become mere corpses entombed in ice but rather vicious undead capable of spreading the curse of blackfrost even further. Cracked, frostbitten flesh that emits a freezing vapor like steam; inexorable, unhindered strides through feet of ash-blackened snow; a vacant, icy-blue gaze devoid of humanity—the descriptions of blackfrost dead vary by the teller, but none can deny the supernatural dread these monsters evoke. Blackfrost dead take a variety of forms. Most are mindless, lumbering brutes, largely indiscernible from mundane zombies except for the curse they can inflict. Others not only maintain their presence of mind but wield powers of psychic corruption not unlike those of blackfrost's originator, Osoyo, the Blackfrost Whale. What form a blackfrost dead takes depends primarily on the victim's psychic fortitude and its aptitude for occult magic. See the curse for further details on blackfrost. Blackfrost Dead Abilities You can modify an existing undead creature to become blackfrost dead using the following abilities. All blackfrost dead bear the curse of blackfrost and have some way to inflict it, usually using one of their existing Strikes. Most blackfrost dead have one other ability from this list as well. As blackfrost dead stem from blackfrost itself, all blackfrost dead have the rare trait. Blackfrost Breath  [two-actions]  (conjuration, occult) The blackfrost dead gasps sharply, then exhales a mist of dark-blue blackfrost particles in a 5-foot emanation. All creatures within the mist become concealed, and all creatures outside the mist become concealed to creatures within it. The mist persists for 1 minute. A creature that ends its turn in the mist is exposed to blackfrost. The blackfrost dead can't use Blackfrost Breath again for 1d4 rounds. Ice Climb The blackfrost dead can climb on ice as though it had the listed climb Speed. It ignores difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain from ice and snow and doesn't risk falling when crossing ice. Mindburning Gaze  [two-actions]  (emotion, fear, necromancy, occult, visual) The blackfrost dead fixes its terrifying gaze on a creature within 60 feet. The creature takes 1d4 mental damage per level of the blackfrost dead (minimum 2d4), with a basic Will save. On a critical failure, the creature is frightened 1. Shattering Death (cold) When the blackfrost dead is destroyed, its body shatters like brittle ice, filling the air around it with a cloud of frigid, razor-sharp ice shards. Creatures in a 10-foot emanation take 1d8 cold damage per level of the blackfrost dead (minimum 3d8), with a basic Reflex save. Creatures that critically fail this save also take 1d6 persistent bleed damage."
"Elemental, Water","Water elementals can be very destructive, but often not intentionally so; just as water can bring life to those in need on the Material Plane, its waves can pound shores and rains can flood cities. Water elementals are similarly difficult to predict."
Octopus,These cunning marine animals live in a variety of ocean habitats.
Boar,"While domesticated pigs are a staple of farm life, wild boars are much more dangerous. Foul-tempered warthogs are relatively common, while the lumbering, primeval beasts known as daeodons are less so. Voracious eaters, boars can ravage the countryside in which they live. Boars breed freely, and a pair of boars can rapidly grow to a large family. Boars are a particular nuisance to farmers, as they break into food stores and root through gardens to sate their hunger."
Mercenaries,"A broad category that includes those wielding arms, spells, or even guile and cunning, mercenaries hire themselves and their expertise to those with the gold to pay for it."
Mummy,"While many cultures practice mummification of the dead for benign reasons, undead mummies are created through foul rituals, typically to provide eternally vigilant guardians."
Bogeyman,"Bogeymen are stealers of innocence and devourers of souls. Few targets who survive an encounter with them remain unchanged. Different names are given to bogeymen according to their varying sizes and degrees of power, which typically advance as the monsters consume more souls."
Boggard,"Boggards are aggressive humanoid amphibians that thrive in swamps, marshes, and even some rain forests. Boggards hatch from eggs into tadpoles, fiercely competing for food and even consuming their siblings in that struggle. Over 3 years, the surviving boggards develops arms, legs, and lungs while learning the rudiments of hunting, crafts, and warfare—everything needed to survive in their might-makes-right society. At the top of most boggard hierarchies lords a hulking swampseer imbued with sinister divine magic."
Bone Skipper,"Orange-headed bone skippers feast on the flesh of the dead, particularly seeking out the marrow in the bones of large carcasses. These strange flies are named for the way they hop about on rotting bodies as they feed, causing the corpses to move and appear as if alive."
Bore Worm,"These Darklands vermin produce corrosive, noxious slime and deliver agonizing bites, whether as a revolting, wriggling swarm of finger-length worms or a single massive, lurching beast. Among Darklands communities, most inhabitants regard bore worms much in the same way surface cultures speak of maggots or cockroaches—with general disdain and revulsion. Children consider catching a single bore worm and using it to torment others a rite of passage, albeit a dangerous one.Variant Bore Worms The humble bore worm is a small and simple creature, both biologically and magically. These qualities allow it to adapt rapidly to different environments, some of them quite extreme, and also makes it susceptible to magical radiation and experimentation. Many a Darklands apprentice takes their first steps in the school of transmutation by practicing on these worms, while variations— both natural and cultivated—are scattered about beneath Golarion's surface. Ice Worms: Found tunneling through the glaciers beneath the Crown of the World, these pale-blue worms behave similarly to their soil-bred cousins, but their frigid acid inflicts marks similar to frostbite on anything they touch. Ice worms still flee from liquid water but are immune to cold rather than to acid, and they substitute cold for acid in all of their attacks and abilities. Lava Worms: Dwelling in the deepest, hottest reaches of the Darklands, these bizarre creatures consume not living matter but minerals and rare earths. They're most often found near volcanoes or open magma and will swim through the lava in pursuit of a meal. Lava worms are immune to fire rather than to acid, and they substitute fire for acid in all of their attacks and abilities. Necral Worms: An undead sorcerer in the ghoul-run Darklands city of Nemret Noktoria developed necral worms about 60 years ago by filling an empress bore worm's abandoned exoskeleton with a unique alchemical paste. These undead bore worms radiate the very energies of death, making them surprisingly sophisticated magical batteries. Less pleasant entities often use them as magical tools. Necral worms have the undead trait and negative healing. They substitute negative damage for acid damage in all of their attacks and abilities, and they gain a weakness to positive damage in place of their weakness to water. Mage-Eater Worms: These luminous, purple worms present just one more reason to avoid the Mana Wastes between Geb and Nex, where magic is unreliable at best and more often dangerously unpredictable. When a creature fails a save against Swarming Bites or Painful Bite, the worms also attempt a counteract check against a single spell affecting the creature (counteract level 3, counteract modifier +12)."
Seafarers,"Adventurers may need passage on a swift vessel, or they might face danger from raiders at sea or in coastal settlements."
Dolphin,"Dolphins encompass a wide range of aquatic mammals, all of which are quite social, intelligent, and widespread through the world’s oceans."
Leech,"Though valued by apothecaries and field medics as methods to reduce swelling or drain blood, leeches are despised by most who encounter them, regardless of the setting."
Brughadatch,"Brughadatches are malevolent fey tricksters with distinct stages of life: they spawn from the First World’s primal energies as esurient tadpoles, grow into humanoids capable of creating enticing illusions, then finally evolve into huge, slothful toads that warp their environs with mere thoughts."
Thylacine,"The thylacine is a marsupial carnivore. This nocturnal predator typically hunts alone, only occasionally forming small packs. Because of their odd appearance, thylacines have a far harsher reputation than they probably should, playing a sort of bogeyman role in farming communities."
Bugbear,"These stealthy and cruel goblinoid creatures delight in spreading fear and tormenting their victims. Bugbears are the monsters lurking in the closet and hiding under the bed. Preying on remote farmsteads, bugbears reveal their presence with thumps in the night or creaks of boards to build lurking dread and arouse suspicion and fear."
Leshy,"Leshys are intelligent plant creatures that guard areas of primeval wilderness or earthly power. Originally created by powerful fey, they manifest when a skilled practitioner of primal magic—typically a druid—combines a nature spirit with a body carefully grown from local vegetation. The rites and materials required to create a leshy vary depending on the type of leshy. They are typically given life in an area of great natural significance, such as an arboreal’s grove, a druidic circle, a fairy ring, or a great natural wonder."
Linnorm,"Immense, primeval dragons of the northern reaches of the world, linnorms hate those they deem to be lesser creatures and seek to inflict as much suffering as possible upon their unfortunate victims. While these serpentine monstrosities might not be the powerful winged dragons most imagine, they nonetheless possess incredible strength and deadly powers that often rival authentic dragon brutality."
Wight,"Wights are undead humanoids that, much like wraiths, can drain the life from living creatures with but a touch. They arise as a result of necromantic rituals, especially violent deaths, or the sheer malevolent will of the deceased. As many types of wights exist as types of people from which they might be created. Hulking brutes, skittering sneaks, and cunning tinkers all make for different wights with different niches to fill. Environment, too, plays a part in determining a wight's special abilities and defenses. Frost wights, for instances, can be found in the parts of the world where exposure is a common end. Regardless, wights typically haunt burial grounds, catacombs, or other places of the dead. But their hunger is targeted toward the living—those individuals who remind them of the shackles of mortality and whom they feel compelled to “free” to the state of undeath. A single wight can wreak a lot of havoc if it is compelled to rise from its tomb. Because creatures slain by wights become wights as well, all it takes is a single wight and a handful of unlucky graveyard visitors to create a veritable horde of these undead. Thus, canny priests and adventurers know that the best solution to a wight problem is swift and total eradication. Care must be taken, though, to destroy wight spawn before attempting to destroy the parent wight, for spawn without a master gain the ability to create spawn of their own. Durable and sustained as they are by negative energy, wights can last in harsh environments without decaying the way some lesser undead do. They might dwell in high mountain passes, sealed passageways, or submerged in bogs or lakes for decades or even centuries before the passage of an unsuspecting traveler rouses them from their rest."
Caligni,"Calignis lurk in subterranean cities, creeping to the surface to steal, stalk, or make mischief. Each caligni serves in a specific role and grows into a specific form as determined by supernatural traditions and influences in caligni society. Regardless of their size or role, all calignis are gaunt, with pale flesh and white eyes. Some surface dwellers call the caligni “dark folk,” a term they dislike because it doesn’t reflect either their appearance or character, only their environment.Each individual in caligni society serves a specific role. At times, certain roles so rarely find suitable candidates that a community might only see a few individuals fill them in an entire generation."
"Elemental, Wood","At first glance, wood elementals might not seem to have the same destructive potential as their cousins from the Planes of Fire, Water, or Air, but don't be fooled. The woods can be a dangerous place. Though some resemble animals, the elemental beasts presented here are still plants, and their life cycles reflect it. Vegetable lambs grow on rooted stalks, from which they can't be removed until they've matured (or perhaps ripened), leaving them dependent on their immediate surroundings for food. Moss sloths are little more than lumps of green fluff for the first century of their existence, only gaining limited mobility once they can grow their defensive wooden claws. "
Catfolk,"Lithe and agile, with catlike features and long tails, the amurruns are wanderers, explorers, and extroverts who share a gregarious nature and an unbridled curiosity. This latter characteristic leads many individual amurruns into trouble, yet this inquisitiveness is paired with a penchant for good fortune that offsets much of their self-induced peril. They accept the term “catfolk” as a name for their people with grace and a hint of amusement. Ever eager to explore and learn, catfolk have spread to other parts of the world from their native nations in the southern tropics, yet never in large groups. A lone catfolk can be found anywhere in the world, but it’s rare to find a settlement beyond their traditional national borders. This is due to their innate wanderlust and insatiable wonder. As many a catfolk might say, “I’ve lived with my people my whole life, but you? You’re new and different! There’s so much to learn from you!” Longstanding amurrun legends claim the catfolk were first created as guardians and were then charged with protecting the world from those sinister forces that exist at its fringes. Often, this charge manifests as a longstanding opposition to cultists of demon lords, archdevils, and other fiendish demigods. Many catfolk worship the spirits of creation, using serendipitous rituals to attract good fortune and banish ill luck in the spirits’ name, while others venerate their own small pantheon of divinities. Those who travel often find comfort in the worship of Desna, whose teachings closely match their own predilections. Catfolk adapt well to adventuring roles, and can be quite diverse in their areas of study and specialization. Those who follow the traditions of rangers and rogues are perhaps the most commonly encountered, but not overwhelmingly so. Their natural curiosity leads some catfolk to take up mystical arts, training as wizards or following a divine path to become clerics."
Psychopomp,"Psychopomps are guardians and shepherds of the dead native to the Boneyard, the vast plane of graves where mortal souls are judged and sent on to their eternal rewards or damnations. Psychopomps ensure that the dead come to terms with their transition from mortality and are properly sorted into the appropriate afterlife. They also protect souls from being preyed upon by supernatural predators. Nearly all psychopomps wear masks, especially when they’re likely to be interacting with mortals, although the types of masks they wear are as varied as the psychopomps themselves. The courts of the Boneyard preside in Requian, a somber yet melodic language spoken slowly with various tonal shifts."
Lizard,"Lizards have a wide range of appearances and abilities, but most share a basic reptilian shape—long tails, wide toothy mouths, and four legs. While a few species are capable of movement on two legs for short periods of time, most are strictly quadrupedal. The three species presented here represent the most common and well-known of the larger species."
Giant,Giants are massive humanoid creatures who live in remote regions throughout the world. They are divided into a number of subtypes.
Troll,"Slavering, cruel, practically invincible brutes: this is the villager’s stock description for the dread monsters known as trolls. But words hardly do justice to trolls’ capacity for destruction. They are as bloodthirsty as orcs but lacking the discipline, as massive as giants but capable of regenerating wounded flesh in an instant, and as reprobate as ogres but with twice the strength. The only way to really understand the wanton violence of a troll is to experience it firsthand—a fate few would wish even upon their worst enemies. The first thing that comes to mind when most think of trolls is the creatures’ power of bodily regeneration. So potent is this regeneration that the only way to overcome it is to exploit the troll’s vulnerability to acid and fire. It is not enough to slay the troll with caustic or flaming weapons, though—even the smallest scrap of a troll’s flesh can regenerate into a full-size troll given enough time. The only sure way to eradicate a troll menace is to burn the monster’s entire body until nothing remains. Trolls are solitary hunters, for their wickedness is anathema even to other giants. They occasionally roam in small gangs of two to four, but only when prey is plentiful or a particularly strong counterforce has broached their hunting grounds. In rare instances, an old and powerful troll comes to lead small tribes of trolls. Such “troll kings” possess enough cunning to lead their hordes in devastating raids and massacres, and their presence permanently alters the surrounding ecosystem. A wide variety of trolls exist, from the terrible monster traditionally associated with the name to the water-dwelling scrag and hybrid flood troll. Regional variations exist as well—mountain trolls among stony peaks, for instance, or moss trolls in swampy bayous— but all share the same trademark regenerative powers and insatiable thirst for blood."
Cecaelila,"Cecaelias resemble humans with octopus tentacles instead of legs. These oceanic hunters are agile and intelligent creatures, but proud. Their inquisitiveness often brings them into contact with strangers, where a poor turn of phrase or an unintended insult can quickly spark their legendary tempers. Cecaelias live nomadic lives, hunting and scavenging along coastlines for food and tradeable trinkets. They engage in frequent trade with terrestrial communities, offering anything from seafood to treasures retrieved from sunken vessels in exchange for goods not readily available underwater. Some take to piracy or hire themselves out as mercenaries, but their quarrelsome disposition invariably leads to them going their own way again before too long. The only non-cecaelia communities that maintain long-lasting relationships with cecaelias are those of the remarkably laid-back locathahs, who coexist with cecaelias in the city of Xidao (page 164). Cecaelias live in warm waters along verdant ocean reefs or coastlines, often near humanoid settlements. Able to adapt rapidly over a few generations, cecaelias adopt the physical features of their closest humanoid neighbors, which sages liken to an octopus's natural camouflage."
Centipede,"Hunters and scavengers that live amid dung and detritus, centipedes are a relatively common and often reviled threat faced by adventurers. Scurrying about with surprising speed on the scores of legs attached to their long, segmented bodies, centipedes strike with poisoned mandibles to slow and torment their prey with a vicious toxin before they settle down to feed in slow and disgusting leisure."
Changeling,"Children of hags, destined to become hags themselves, changelings face a life of conflict. Born of supernatural creatures who kill and consume the child’s father, changelings are deposited into their father’s society to be raised. These offspring appear to be members of their paternal ancestry, and changelings have been found among dwarves, gnomes, orcs, goblins, and numerous others, but human-ancestry changelings are by far the most common. Within the normal range for their ancestry, changelings tend toward slighter builds, darker hair, and pale complexions, though their most common feature is a nearly universal heterochromia, leading to widespread superstition about individuals with differently colored eyes. As changelings come of age, they sometimes manifest abilities granted by their hag heritage. Some gain the ability to see in the dark, some grow fingernails long and hard enough to serve as claws, and others gain even stranger abilities specific to their hag mother. For instance, dream mays, the children of night hags or their cousins the dreamthief hags, can gain an enhanced ability to resist the magic of dreams and sleep. Other types of changelings include slag mays, the children of annis hags; callow mays, the children of green hags; brine mays, the children of sea hags; and others for each type of hag. As beings infused with supernatural power, changelings find themselves able to command various traditions of magic, with many drawn to either the occult magic common among hags or primal magic. At roughly the same time in their lives, many changelings— women in particular—begin to hear the Call, a psychic urging from their hag mother luring them away from the communities that raised them. If followed, the Call eventually leads the changeling to the hag’s coven, where they are subjected to terrible rituals that twist them into hags themselves. Some changelings, especially those who have strong social bonds or embrace druidic traditions, are able to resist this Call and continue on with their mortal lives. The fact that the Call disproportionately targets female changelings has led to a widespread misunderstanding that all changelings are female, while in fact male changelings are simply assumed to be members of their paternal ancestry."
Animated Bones,"Commonly mistaken for undead, animated bones are mindless constructs with no connection to necromancy. The following are examples of typical animated bones."
Visitant,"Although the wild creatures seen at traveling circuses can entertain and amaze, the lives of such animals and beasts are sometimes sad and cruel. Circus owners who mistreat their animals through harsh discipline or overtraining see little wrong with their mercilessness, even going so far as to slaughter their entertainers—supposedly “by accident”—via neglect or abuse. The victims of such cruelty who cannot move onto the afterlife—either because they somehow become infused with negative energy or their spirits cannot rest without first enacting revenge on their assailants—occasionally rise from the dead as visitants. These undead monsters haunt the sites of their demise and search out the masters who made their lives so hellish with only one goal in mind: vengeance. When they can’t locate their particular abuser, or if they are still unable to rest even after confronting their aggressor, visitants seek out similarly evil harmers of animals, becoming torturers of torturers. However, visitants are for the most part unable to distinguish between individual members of a species; thus, if a visitant was abused by a human trainer, any human that crosses its path may become a target of its rage. A visitant resembles a zombified animal, but it retains a spark of the animal intelligence it had in life, making it all the more dangerous as a result. Visitants’ bodies are marred by the horrors of their brutal existences: Their mouths are furrowed in a constant snarl, with a black ichor dripping from their cracked, rotten lips. Whip scars from their hours of “training” glow with an unnatural purple light. And perhaps above all, their eyes mark them as touched by undeath—sunken horribly deep into their skull, leaking blood or other fluid, and glowing with an aura of dread and palpable anger. Visitant Abilities You can modify visitants by applying the following abilities. Most visitants have one of these abilities, but more powerful visitants might have more, in which you might consider increasing the visitant’s level and statistics. Noxious Breath  [two-actions]  The visitant exhales sharply, releasing pungent fumes from its lungs in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must succeed at a Fortitude save or become sickened 1 (sickened 2 on a critical failure). Roar  [one-action]  (auditory, concentrate, emotion, enchantment, fear, mental, primal) The visitant lets out a loud and horrifying roar. Each creature within 100 feet must attempt at a Will save. No matter the result, affected creatures are then temporarily immune to the effect for 1 minute. Critical Success The creature is unaffected. Success The creature is frightened 1. Failure The creature is frightened 2. Critical Failure The creature is frightened 3. Vengeful Presence (aura, emotion, enchantment, mental) 20 feet. A creature that starts its turn within the visitant’s aura must succeed at a Will save or be overcome with a thirst for vengeance. For 1d4 rounds (1 minute on a critical failure), if the affected creature was attacked within the last round (whether or not the attack hit), the creature must use at least 1 action per round to Strike or use a hostile action toward its last attacker as long as the attacker is still alive. Failure to do so deals the affected creature 1d6 mental damage, plus 1d6 for every 5 levels the visitant has. Wrestle  [one-action]  The visitant makes a claw Strike against a creature it has grabbed. If the attack hits, that creature is knocked prone."
Tsukumogami,"Tsukumogami are intelligent, mobile objects formed from the union between a 100-year-old object and a kami. Tsukumogami range from harmless to malicious, each individual personality a result of how the object was treated before its awakening. Well-cared-for objects tend to birth helpful, friendly tsukumogami, while mistreated or abandoned objects twist into malevolent and violent beings. Most tsukumogami are, by nature, mischievous, and oftentimes want nothing more than to occupy the attention of living creatures. Tsukumogami can commonly be found in areas with a strong cultural belief in the value of caring for objects, which helps items survive long enough to become tsukumogami. Towns and villages with large tsukumogami populations are referred to as “sleepless towns” due to the nightly tsukumogami celebrations, which can become so raucous that they prevent the living residents from sleeping peacefully. "
Explorers,"The world is a wide, open place fraught with peril and adventure. Explorers use their knowledge of nature and survival skills to see every corner of the land."
"Elemental, Fire",Fire elementals are destructive manifestations of the scorching Plane of Fire.
Skull Swarm,"A skull swarm is composed of reanimated masses of craniums and jawbones, forming a terrifying avalanche of undead fury. Most skull swarms are mindless, though some retain a vestige of wit, awareness, and even magical talents from life, culminating in a highly intelligent swarm mind. "
Clockworks,"Intricate, complex machines, clockworks are built with care by highly skilled engineers. Though their creation involves some amount of magic, they're primarily mechanical, packed with precision-tuned gears and springs working in concert. The sturdy mainspring within a clockwork must be wound to provide the energy needed to power the device. Some larger clockworks contain a series of springs for different limbs that each need to be wound. A clockwork's crafter creates a unique metal key while building the clockwork; winding the clockwork usually involves inserting the key into the machine's back and turning clockwise. Larger clockworks require greater strength to turn the key, and typically have larger keys to allow for more torque—some even accommodating a team of winders rather than an individual. Programming a clockwork requires both the key and the knowledge to set the program correctly, information usually reserved for the clockwork's creator or owner. Winding Clockworks A clockwork must be wound to remain operational. Each clockwork has the wind-up ability, with the specifics listed in its stat block. Wind-Up For a clockwork to act, it must be wound with a unique key by another creature. This takes 1 minute. Once wound, it remains operational for the listed amount of time, usually 24 hours, after which time it becomes unaware of its surroundings and can't act until it's wound again. Some clockworks' abilities require them to spend some of their remaining operational time. They can't spend more than they have and shut down immediately once they have 0 time remaining. If it's unclear when a clockwork was last wound, most clockwork keepers wind all their clockworks at a set time, typically 8 a.m. A clockwork that lists standby in its wind-up entry can enter standby mode as a 3-action activity. Its operational time doesn't decrease in standby, but it can sense its surroundings (with a –2 penalty to Perception). It can't act, with one exception: when it perceives a creature, it can exit standby as a reaction (rolling initiative if appropriate). A creature can attempt to Disable a Device to wind a clockwork down (with a DC listed in the wind-up entry). For each success, the clockwork loses 1 hour of operational time. This can be done even if the clockwork is in standby mode."
Cobble Mite,"Cobble mites resemble squarish stones a few inches across with mouths like split geodes. Though indolent and harmless alone, they're dangerous in large groups."
Cockroach,"Generally seen more as a nuisance than a personal danger, cockroaches inhabit most reaches of the world. They are scavengers who live off the detritus of the natural world and from those that inhabit it. These maligned insects can survive weeks without eating, and most of their meals consist of organic waste that would otherwise overwhelm an ecosystem, particularly in their preferred urban environments. Though a typical cockroach presents virtually no threat, they can become dangerous in large groups, and some species grow particularly large."
Eurypterid,"Fearsome predators and durable pests, eurypterids are hard-carapaced arthropods sometimes referred to as sea scorpions. Though aquatic creatures, they have robust respiratory systems that allow them to survive indefinitely on land. All eurypterids possess claws as well as stingers that can inject venom. "
Contemplative of Ashok,"The ancestors of the Contemplatives of Ashok were humanoids of vast intellect who unlocked occult powers. They deliberately evolved their mental faculties at the expense of their physical forms, and their atrophied bodies dangle beneath giant brains."
Wisp,Nethys Note: this is not an official family and is a gathering of related creatures
Crawling Hand,"Typically, crawling hands are formed when severed appendages are endowed with a crude sentience by evil necromantic energies that turn them into tireless killers. Yet crawling hands can also arise spontaneously, usually when a creature loses an appendage in a place rife with necromantic energy or with a connection to the Negative Energy Plane."
Crocodile,"Powerful and primeval in appearance, crocodiles are dangerous natural predators that dwell in marshes, riverbeds, swamps, and other wetlands."
"Elemental, Earth",Earth elementals make excellent bodyguards for adventuresome spelunkers and are ideal protectors of important subterranean locations such as vaults and treasuries.
Spirit Guide,"Spirit guides are a distinctive form of spiritual entity with a tenuous attachment to the Material Plane. Some legends say that the first spirit guides were the perfect conceptual forms of animals, and that from them, eagles, foxes, bears, and other mortal animals were born. Each guide displayed an interest in mortal affairs, watching over communities and imparting their gifts. Fox shared his cunning with the mortals he befriended, while Bear taught them how to survive and endure. Over the passing of countless mortal generations, new spirit guides were born, many of them possessing traits from two or more of the original spirit guides. In the ancient human nation of Sarkoris, the people abandoned the worship of traditional gods in favor of venerating the spirit guides who watched over them. While the people of some neighboring nations saw this as heresy, to the old Sarkorians, this worship was perfectly natural. The same beings who had taught their forebears lessons that allowed them to survive and thrive still walked among them. Spirit guides can form bonds with mortal partners. While many spirit guides create a permanent bond with a mortal, such as the relationship between the spirit guides of Sarkoris and the mortal spiritual leaders known as god callers, some instead form temporary bonds, either to test the prospective mortal before committing or because a permanent bond is undesirable. It's not uncommon for a single spirit guide to form bonds with recurring generations of a family or community, protecting and guiding mortals they've grown fond of or who do them a great service."
Cyclops,"The cyclopes are violent giants with a tragic past. Although they possess only one eye, they could once see far more than most, possessing occult wisdom and divinatory magic that gave them the mystic ability of foresight. But their legendary oracular powers failed to prevent the fall of their society, and the vast kingdoms of the cyclops long ago collapsed into ruin. Today, cyclopes have forgotten much of what they once knew, and they skulk among the crumbling remains of their fallen cities like forgotten kings and queens gone mad."
Titan,"Created by ancient deities long before the rise of mortal ancestries, titans united and attempted to overthrow their deific progenitors. The resulting war still figures prominently throughout mortal myths, in which most titans were cast down and imprisoned for eons."
Rakshasa,"Rakshasas are evil spirits that cloak themselves in the guises of humanoid creatures, that they might walk unseen among their prey. They embody what is taboo among most societies, and in the shape of those they seek to defile, rakshasas gorge themselves on these hideous acts. A wide range of rakshasas exist; presented below are the diminutive, sinister dandasuka rakshasa and the infamous raja rakshasa, who are the most widespread and commonly encountered of these fiends."
Beheaded,"Beheaded are the reanimated heads of decapitation victims. These mindless undead fly through the air or roll around to attack their prey. Beheaded Abilities Beheaded can manifest with a variety of abilities, such as those presented below. Bleeding The beheaded is covered in slimy blood. The target of a successful Strike is splattered with gore and must succeed at a Fortitude save or become sickened 1. Entangling Long, stringy hair clings to the beheaded's scalp. Its Strikes gain the Grab ability. Fiendish (aura, divine, emotion, fear, mental, necromancy) 30 feet. The beheaded has a twisted, unsettling countenance. Foes that begin their turn in the area must succeed at a Will save or be frightened 1. Giant A beheaded created from the head of a giant is a Medium creature, gaining 2 levels and one or more additional beheaded abilities.Alternate Beheaded AbilitiesSource Book of the Dead pg. 74 Lifesense The beheaded has imprecise lifesense out to 60 feet. Whispering (aura, emotion, fear, mental, necromancy) 30 feet. The beheaded constantly whispers twisted incantations in unknown languages secret and foul. Foes that enter or begin their turn in the area must succeed at a Will save or be stupefied 1. The aura uses the moderate DC for the beheaded's level. Furious Headbutt  Frequency once per round; Effect The beheaded makes a wild Strike, taking a –2 penalty to its AC until the end of its next turn. If the Strike damages a creature, it deals additional damage equal to the beheaded's level.
"
Naga,"Nagas are serpentine beings with magical powers and keen, nearly inscrutable intellects. Physically, they resemble massive snakes with eerie visages that resemble those of humans. Nagas use their innate magic and poisonous fangs to keep all but the most stalwart foes at bay. Beyond the natural weapons they use to ward away foes, little is understood of the naga’s unsettling physiology. Nagas are intelligent creatures with powerful needs to pursue, be they the accumulation of knowledge, the collection of rare art, or the rule of an entire nation. On Golarion, the nation of Nagajor is one such society—an entire empire ruled by nagas and populated by reptilian humanoids who serve their naga rulers with a patriotic pride that borders on worship. Still, most adventurers interact with nagas on a much smaller scale, encountering them as dangerous guardians in remote locations or not-so-abandoned ruins. In many cases, these nagas have heard of distant Nagajor, but they are usually unwilling to abandon their own pursuits to seek out a land where they might be worshipped as gods."
"Mantis, Giant",These monstrously oversized insects are silent predators with lightning-quick forelegs and a bone-breaking bite.
Deathless Acolyte,"Deathless acolytes are an oddity among undead, neither willingly transformed nor, strictly speaking, transformed against their will. The creation of a deathless acolyte is an act of direct intervention by a deity, typically as a double-edged reward and curse granted to a faithful priest who failed in completing a divine mandate due to circumstances beyond their control. Deathless Deities Urgathoa isn't the only deity who has deathless acolytes. Other deities of death and war have their own deathless servitors. Included below are adjustments that can be quickly applied to the above stat blocks to modify them for other deities. Make the following adjustments and see the sample deity entry below. Alignment match the acolyte's deity Aura replace the acolyte's aura with an alternate one (see below) if it's more appropriate Chastise Heretic and Denounce Heretic apply to anyone who doesn't follow the acolyte's deity Spells replace goblin pox and false life with spells from the acolyte's deity's spells Domain Spells use the domain spells from one of the deity's domains Weapon replace the scythe with the deity's favored weapon Example Deity: Gorum (CN) The mortality rate among priests of Gorum is exceptionally robust, as are the ranks of his deathless acolytes. Aura field of bloodshed Domain Spells athletic rush, enduring might (hierophant only) Spells replace goblin pox with true strike and false life with enlarge Weapon greatsword (1d12 slashing, versatile P) Alternate Aura Field of Bloodshed (abjuration, aura, divine) 20 feet (hierophant 40). All creatures within the aura gain a +2 status bonus to damage with weapon Strikes. Creatures within the aura who attempt to Cast a Spell that doesn't deal damage must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the spell fails, and the slot or Focus Point is wasted."
Deep Gnome,"These distant cousins to gnomes are reclusive, underground dwellers. Svirfneblins, as deep gnomes call themselves, have skin the color of gray or brown stone. While deep gnome males are bald, women have thin, pale-gray hair, and all have the large, expressive eyes typical among all gnomes. A deep gnome is 3 feet tall and weighs approximately 65 pounds. Deep gnomes rarely interact with those outside of their small cavern communities, and they are slow to trust outsiders, sometimes keeping them imprisoned for years simply to prevent them from informing others of the deep gnome settlement. The first deep gnomes rose in the underground world some time after their early gnome ancestors migrated from the First World to Golarion. A group of these migrants elected to settle underground instead of on the surface, and it was from these gnomes that the svirfneblin came to be. Some believe the gnomes chose the Darklands as their home to watch for and stop any evil fey who might infiltrate the underground region, but much like the exact reasons for the gnomes' relocation, their motivation has been lost to time. Thousands of years of living in subterranean caverns with little to no light transformed the physical characteristics of the gnomes living there into those of the deep gnome of today. Though deep gnomes may seem dour and recalcitrant at first glance, they retain the fey blood of their ancestors. In fact, deep gnomes are sometimes more emotionally erratic than their gnome cousins, lashing out violently at what seems like the smallest provocation. Such an explosion is often followed by an extended period of quiet brooding. Despite this, deep gnome communities are close-knit, as each citizen knows when to give the others the space they require to process their feelings. Many deep gnome settlements have clashed with nearby duergar communities for myriad reasons: resources, territory, and even religion and morality. Over the centuries, some of these disputes have evolved into full wars, with many lives lost on both sides. Neither deep gnomes nor duergars are particularly proud of these conflicts, but both insist they were in the right each time. The ferocity with which most duergars fight has left a deep impression on the psyches of some deep gnome communities, leading them to distrust all dwarves and dwarf-like ancestries even more than other strangers. This can result in non-duergar dwarves being driven off from deep gnome cities before being able to explain themselves. A dwarf and even those traveling with a dwarf require patience and tenacity when attempting to deal with deep gnomes holding such views. Svirfneblins value crafting and many decorate their cavernous homes with paintings on the walls, often incorporating the rock in clever ways. They also value crystals and gems, making jewelry and beads that they string through their hair."
Dhuthorex,"Strange things swim in sunless seas, but few as fierce as the shark-like dhuthorexes. These beasts chase prey fearlessly and tenaciously."
Lich,"To gain more time to complete their goals, some desperate spellcasters pursue immortality by embracing undeath. After long years of research and the creation of a special container called a soul cage, a spellcaster takes the final step by imbibing a deadly concoction or casting dreadful incantations that transform them into a lich. While most undertake this drastic plan to continue their work or fulfill some long-term plan, others become liches because they fear death or to fulfill some malevolent purpose, such as long-sworn revenge. Regardless, the result is permanent and carries with it the potential to alter history—both that of those who transform themselves and of the countless mortals that will inevitably suffer as a result of a lich's new power. After its metamorphosis, a lich often finds some quiet place to dwell, typically protected by a variety of guardians and traps, for two primary purposes. First, a lich requires solitude in order to plan its elaborate schemes, and second, few mortals (if any) deign to interact with these legendarily corrupt necromancers. One reason begets the other, as the self-imposed isolation of a lich often drives the lich insane, further solidifying its separation from civilization. The longer a lich lives, the more meticulous a planner it becomes, secreting itself within a labyrinth of deadly puzzles, misdirection, and monsters. A lich's servants and guardians are absolutely loyal, either due to their nature (such as constructs or other undead) or as a result of compulsion using powerful magic. Many liches go mad, in time, and the nature of a lich's lair is a good indicator of the undead's current mental state. For all the protections it arrays around itself, a lich will go to greater lengths to guard its soul cage, as it knows that the destruction of this magical container spells doom for the lich. A lich is notoriously difficult to bargain with, though the threat of damaging its soul cage is a sure way to gain the upper hand in such a negotiation."
Demon Throng,"Demons are legion. Countless examples crowd the Abyss, many of which have yet to be categorized by mortal scholars. In the Abyss, might very much makes right, and so despite their chaotic nature, weaker demons often gather together to enjoy safety in numbers. "
Dero,"Deros are short, wiry humanoids with milky white eyes, gray-blue skin, and wild shocks of off-white or gray hair. The descendants of a mysterious type of fey abandoned in the deepest, darkest caverns of Golarion, deros are the subject of fearful legends and folk tales to most of the world’s surface races. They skulk beneath major metropolitan areas, performing cruel and twisted experiments on unwilling subjects. A dero is 3 feet tall and weighs approximately 70 pounds."
Drake,"Ravenous, bestial, and driven by instinct—drakes are primitive draconic monsters who bear a fraction of the terrifying might of their larger cousins but little (if any) of the cunning. While they’re weaker, slower, and less inclined toward reason than dragons, drakes are nonetheless a menace to creatures and settlements around them. Their propensity for forming raiding parties—small social groups fittingly called “rampages”—makes them all the more dangerous; a single rampage of river drakes can quickly lay waste to a waterside village, and roving rampages of desert drakes are a plague to caravan traders. Drakes share a number of physical characteristics that unite them as one species despite their wide variety of habitats and abilities. For example, drakes lack forearms, leaving them only their formidable jaws and thick-scaled tails with which to attack if engaged at melee range. Most drakes would rather avoid close combat, however, preferring to use their breath weapons to wreak havoc in wide swaths from comfortable distances while flying overhead. Finally, all drakes have small reservoirs of their ancestral draconic power that they can tap into to perform incredible feats of speed. Drake Eggs While drake hides aren’t any more valuable than those of other, similarly sized creatures, drake eggs are prized commodities. While they are used as components in powerful spells as well as eaten by various cultures, the most common use for drake eggs is hatching and rearing drakes to serve as mounts and guardians. A typical drake lays a clutch of 2d4 eggs every 5 years. Eggs hatch within 3 to 6 weeks, during which time they must be kept in conditions appropriate to their natural environment, perhaps the most difficult aspect of drake husbandry. While it is generally easy for breeders to incubate the eggs of desert or jungle drakes (which require mildly warm temperatures to hatch) or river drakes (which must be submerged in running water), the eggs of flame and frost drakes require extreme temperatures in order to hatch, which can be difficult to replicate safely. A drake egg has Hardness 3, 5 HP, and BT 5. The coloration of drake eggs varies only slightly from one species to the next. A creature must succeed at a DC 20 Nature check, or a relevant DC 20 Lore check, to identify the drake species of a specific egg. Once a drake hatches, it imprints on the first creature that it sees. A creature imprinted on in this way gains a +5 bonus to Nature checks to train or command that drake. The market price of a drake egg varies depending on the region, the type of drake, and the exact purpose the buyer has in mind, but typically depends on the level of the drake. Because drakes are evil, dangerous, and intelligent creatures, many societies do not condone the trade of drake eggs and criminalize those who engage in it. It takes 2 years for a drake hatchling to grow to full size. A well-trained drake can make a fearsome mount or guardian, but many careless would-be drake trainers are devoured by their charges due to cruelty, overconfidence, or general lack of skill."
Dhampir,"As the mortal offspring of a vampire and a living parent, dhampirs occupy an unusual place among the living. Their vampiric parentage lends them elongated incisors, an unearthly beauty and physical grace, a ghostly pallor, and a piercing gaze. Perhaps their most distinctive feature, however, is their connection to negative energy, which heals them, leaving them as vulnerable to positive energy as any undead creature. Though they don’t suffer the full range of a vampire’s vulnerabilities, they do share certain characteristics with their vampire parent, leading to several distinct dhampir heritages across Golarion. By far the most common dhampirs are svetocher, the children of the more common moroi vampires. Many dhampirs lived their childhoods as orphans, often because their mortal parents believed their child to be cursed and abandoned them, or perished as a result of a difficult childbirth. Often outcast, some dhampirs leverage their charisma and personal magnetism to manipulate those around them, while others struggle to form relationships. Frequent mistrust of a dhampir’s parentage present further challenges when dhampirs attempt to integrate into mortal society. Those who seek out their vampiric parent instead often find themselves considered inferior, rejected as they were with regular mortals but for different reasons. But in regions like Nidal, Geb, and Ustalav, where vampires themselves carry some degree of respect, dhampirs can sometimes find their heritage empowering. Dhampirs fill countless roles within many communities. Some prefer to blend in as best they can, holding regular jobs and building families (most children born to dhampirs share an ancestry with the dhampir’s mortal parent, but a rare few are born as dhampirs themselves). Those who learn to make the most of their inherited charm can achieve a high societal status, whether leveraging traditional avenues of power or gathering followers enamored by the dhampir’s abilities. With a lifespan rivaling that of an elf, a dhampir can develop extensive influence and engage in long-reaching schemes of massive scope. Further, their ancestry lends them a proclivity to necromancy and the occult arts."
Wolf,"Wolves roam forests, hills, and other wild lands, where they hunt in packs to beleaguer and surround their prey before going in for the kill. Like most predatory animals, wolves prefer to attack the weakest or most vulnerable prey they can find."
Zombie,"A zombie's only desire is to consume the living. Unthinking and ever-shambling harbingers of death, zombies stop only when they're destroyed. Zombie Abilities You can modify zombies with the following zombie abilities. Most zombies have one of these abilities; If you give a zombie more, you might want to increase its level and adjust its statistics. The DCs use the zombie's level from the Spell DC and Spell Attack Bonus table. Disgusting Pustules (disease, necromancy) The zombie is covered in pustules that rupture when it takes any piercing damage or any critical hit. In either case, adjacent creatures are hit with vile fluid, causing them to become sickened 1 unless they succeed at a Fortitude save. Feast  [two-actions]  (manipulate) If the zombie is adjacent to a helpless or unconscious creature, or a deceased creature that died in the past hour, the zombie can feast upon its flesh to heal itself. This restores an amount of Hit Points equal to the zombie's level. If the creature is alive, the zombie deals damage equal to its jaws, flst, or claw damage. Plague-Ridden (disease, necromancy) The zombie carries a plague that can create more of its own kind. This functions as the plague zombie's zombie rot, except at stage 5, the victim rises as another of the zombie's type, rather than a plague zombie. Rotting Aura (aura, disease, necromancy) The zombie emits an aura of rot and disease that causes wounds to fester and turn sour. Any living creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the zombie and is not at full Hit Points takes 1d6 damage as its wounds fester. This damage increases by 1d6 for every 6 levels the zombie has. Creatures that take a critical hit from the zombie also take this damage immediately. Unkillable This zombie is nigh unkillable. The zombie loses its weakness to slashing and gains resistance against all damage equal to its level (minimum 3), and it gains weakness equal to twice its level (minimum 6) to critical hits. Increase the zombie's level by 1 if you give it this ability. Additional Monster AbilitiesBestiary 3You can modify zombies with the following zombie abilities, in addition to those found on page 340 of the Bestiary. Most zombies have one of these abilities; if you give a zombie more, you might want to increase its level and adjust its statistics. Ankle Biter This zombie fights just as well on the ground as it does standing. While prone, the zombie isn't flat-footed, it ignores the status penalty to its attack rolls, and it gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to Trip. The zombie can also move up to half its Speed when it Crawls. Persistent Limbs The first time the zombie is critically hit with a melee or ranged Strike, a limb falls off its body and continues to attack. The limb acts on the zombie's initiative; each round it can Stride up to half the zombie's Speed and make a Strike. The limb uses and contributes to the zombie's multiple attack penalty. Putrid Stench (aura, olfactory) 15 feet. The zombie's rotting flesh is particularly malodorous. A creature that enters the area must attempt a Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is sickened 1, and on a critical failure, the creature also takes a –5-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. While within the aura, the creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty to saves to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to all zombies' putrid stenches for 1 minute. Unholy Speed The zombie gains a +10 status bonus to all its SpeedsBook of the Dead Infested The zombie's flesh is infested with swarming vermin. When the zombie is hit with a critical hit or destroyed, the swarm is set free. Its initiative is immediately after the zombie's. If the swarm is 4 or more levels lower than the zombie, it isn't worth XP (and doesn't add its XP to the encounter budget). Spitting Zombie The zombie spits acid as a ranged Strike with a range of 30 feet. This uses the highest attack bonus among the zombie's Strikes and deals 1d12 acid damage per 3 levels of the zombie (or 1d6 acid damage below level 3). On a critical hit, the target also takes 1d4 persistent acid damage per 3 levels of the zombie. Once used, the zombie must spend 1 action to cough up enough acid to use this ability again. Tearing Grapple The zombies work in groups to rip foes to pieces. Whenever a zombie with this ability successfully Grapples a foe that's already grabbed or restrained by another zombie with this ability, they violently struggle over the poor victim, dealing fist damage (or a similar Strike's damage if the zombie doesn't have a fist Strike). If the grapple is a critical success, the target takes double damage and ceases being grabbed or restrained by any other creatures. If the zombie has the Grab ability, using Grab deals half its fist Strike damage to the target."
Divine Warden,"Created through complex rituals performed by a faith's adherents, divine wardens have been imbued with a fraction of the power that courses through a champion or cleric of a particular deity. This divine spark allows the divine warden to serve as the protector for a temple, shrine, or other holy site. Such guardians aren't intrinsically bound to a fixed location, but they rarely leave the temple or site over which they watch. Most divine wardens have been crafted from clay, stone, wood, or similar materials and typically have features that resemble a deity or a deity's herald. Divine wardens often have other abilities typically exhibited by constructs, such as armor plating, the ability to disguise themselves as statues, or other similar benefits. The faithful worshippers who craft divine wardens typically animate the constructs using a special ritual in which the followers beseech their deity to empower the guardian. The divine mandate that imbues a divine warden with power also allows the sentinel to recognize enemies of its deity and prevents the construct from attacking other members of the faith, unless these patrons choose to attack it first. In rare cases or particularly dire times, a deity might create a divine warden by directly animating an existing statue or idol to aid faithful followers. These divine guardians are most likely to be found outside of their original locations, assisting displaced congregations or pursuing those who might harm the faithful. "
Genie,"A unique type of genie exists for each Elemental Plane, and the bodies of genies are formed out of elemental matter corresponding to their native plane: djinn are formed from wind, clouds, and storms; efreet are fire made flesh; marids are beings of water; and shaitans are composed of metal, gems, and stone. Lastly, the jann are formed out of all four elements, and are the weakest of geniekind. Genie Nobles Genie nobles with titles unique to their kind (as detailed in each sidebar) rule genie society. Genie nobles are generally at least 5 levels higher than a typical example of their kind. In addition to the increased statistics afforded by their higher levels, genie nobles gain additional spells. But the most wondrous (and notorious) of a genie noble’s powers is their ability to grant wishes. Any genie noble (save for jann, who lack this power) can grant a mortal or undead creature up to three wishes within a year’s time. Many unscrupulous creatures compel genie nobles to serve them, tricking them or entrapping them with magic. However, once a genie noble grants a third wish to a single creature, they are freed from service to that creature forever."
Laborers,"Every day, laborers perform backbreaking physical work."
House Spirit,"House spirits are shy, often helpful, sometimes wrathful fey that dwell alongside peasants and farmers. They reside in the house, in the yard, in the granary, in the bathhouse—wherever people build and live. Due to this proximity, house spirits often take on the mannerisms or appearance of nearby mortals. Their reclusive nature and tendency to go unseen earned them the moniker of “spirits,” though in truth they are fully embodied fey. House spirits take an almost parental interest in “their” mortals. Given proper respect, these fey work tirelessly for their charges—they chop wood, care for livestock, mend clothes, sweep the floor, and tend to the stove. If offended, though, the house spirit becomes a menace, frightening animals or children and ruining belongings."
Agathion,"These celestial outsiders hail from Nirvana, the plane of purest good. Agathions are born from the souls of mortals who attained the enlightenment they sought in life, sometimes even after death. Because they all start out as mortals who were rewarded for their determination, self-awareness, and purity of heart, agathions are more likely than other celestials to intervene in working nonviolently against the spread of evil on the material plane. Agathions have served as moderators between the chaotic azatas and lawful archons, so they know how vital communication with mortals can be to bridge differences and ensure that evil doesn't win out. All agathions possess animal-like aspects, some appear more anthropomorphic, while others spend most of their time in forms nearly indistinguishable from true animals. Still others prefer to shapeshift as they see fit, or present as humanoid when in the company of humanoid mortals. Each type of agathion serves a specific role in Nirvana. Their duties and forms generally reflect the core values they cultivated in life that led them to their enlightenment. Since agathions receive their animal forms as rewards for their mortal lives, they take great insult with insinuations that they're merely magical talking beasts or—even worse—that their forms are a curse or punishment. "
Deadly Puffball,Many benign puffball fungi cling to the detritus of forest floors in Darklands caverns. These fungi's giant versions are more mobile and dangerous.
Sprite,"Elusive, flighty, and ebullient, sprites are what many villagers first imagine when they hear the terms “fey” or “fairy.” While their dispositions vary from the benevolent grig to the trickster pixie, all sprites share a connection to magic and diminutive size. This family of fey shares its name with its slightest and most populous member, the common sprite."
Spider,Few everyday vermin inspire as much dread as the infamous spider.
Fleshwarp,"Some creatures, notably drow, are not happy with merely killing their enemies. They revel in the total degradation of their foes through the horrifying transformative technique known as fleshwarping. Though the fleshwarping process was not created by the drow, many believe they perfected it. The drow torture their enemies in vats of churning magical reagents, reshaping their flesh and psyche alike into horrid and monstrous things. The reconstitution of flesh results in countless variations of fleshwarps, and the following are just a couple of examples of these horrors.Although twisting victims into horrid shapes is a well-known pastime of evil drow, other subterranean monsters have stolen these practices or developed them independently. The worm-like seugathis sometimes warp other creatures whose territories abut their lightless lands; the fleshwarps below result from morlocks and urdefhans, respectively."
Drow,"The first drow were elves who fled into the depths of the world from a devastating cataclysm thousands of years ago. In their journey below, they fell to bickering and in-fighting, drawing the attention of sinister intelligences beyond their own. Whether it was the influence of a specific demon lord, the Rough Beast Rovagug, or some other fell force is unknown, but in that time the elves transformed both spiritually and physically, tainting their hearts with desires for cruelty, sadism, and violence. The hues of their eyes became sinister red or bleached white, and their flesh adopted an unearthly lavender sheen that made the drow instantly recognizable. The drow also developed potent magical abilities and resistances that further empowered them, if at the cost of their souls. Over the centuries to follow, the drow developed into a powerful, if violently dysfunctional society, influenced by the worship of demon lords and focused on providing power and glory to a relatively small collection of noble houses. Many of these noble houses are matriarchal in nature and all hold allegiance to a specific demon lord patron—but traditions of worship, warfare, and wizardry help to bind the oft-bickering houses together enough that drow society doesn’t simply consume itself from within. Fear of earning the wrath of one’s superior—be it a teacher, a parent, a commander, or the demon one worships—is the real bond holding drow society together, and this system is held in esteem by the lowliest drow servant and by the most powerful drow priestess alike. The drow are infamous throughout the world, but until recently most assumed stories of demon-worshipping, underground-dwelling elves were spooky legends crafted to share around a campfire. Today, the existence of drow is an understood truth, and while their presence in the dark caverns deep below is unsettling, they seem content to leave the surface world alone for now."
Nymph,"Nymphs are a family of fey that take the form of beautiful humanoids with elven features and have a deep association with the natural world. The most common of their kind are the dryads, which are spirits that embody great trees, but many other kinds of nymphs exist, including naiads, who watch over bodies of water. All nymphs are guardians of some element of nature, typically a specific tree or pond, or even—in the case of nymph queens—whole forests or massive bodies of water. Nymph Queens Nymph queens are powerful nymphs that rule over entire regions of untouched wilderness, not just single trees or ponds. Every variety of nymph can have a queen. Naiad queens are among the most prominent, and more often interact with nearby mortals. Thus, some scholars refer to naiad queens as simply “nymphs.” Nymph Queen Abilities A nymph queen is 6 to 10 levels higher than an ordinary nymph of the same type, with enhanced numerical statistics and improved Strikes to match. A nymph queen’s ward is a significant region, and she strengthens and vivifies this territory with her presence. Nymph queens are not dependent on their wards and lose the corresponding ability (such as a dryad’s tree dependent ability); instead, they gain the tied to the land ability, as described below. A nymph queen also gains the nymph’s beauty aura and the Focus Beauty action, which have varying effects based on the queen’s original type. She gains the Inspiration ability, allowing her to bestow a gift of inspiration on those who catch her fancy, and the Change Shape ability to change her form. Finally, she gains primal prepared spells as a druid of her level. Change Shape  [one-action]  (polymorph, primal, transmutation) Nymph queens can transform between their original form, which looks much like a typical nymph of their kind, and any Small or Medium humanoid form, typically choosing a more humanoid-looking version of their natural form. Focus Beauty  [one-action]  (emotion, enchantment, mental, primal, visual) The nymph queen focuses her beauty upon a target within her aura. The creature must attempt a Will save. On a failure, it is affected as if by the nymph queen’s nymph’s beauty aura; if it was already affected by the aura, it suffers a greater effect described in the nymph queen’s entry. A nymph queen can Focus Beauty on a given creature only once per turn. Inspiration  [three-actions]  (emotion, enchantment, mental, primal) A nymph queen can inspire a single intelligent creature by giving that creature a token of her favor, typically a lock of her hair. As long as the creature carries her token and remains in good standing with the nymph queen, the creature gains a +1 status bonus to all Crafting checks, Performance checks, and Will saves. If a nymph queen grants her Inspiration to a bard and the nymph queen is that bard’s muse, the bard gains an additional benefit depending on their muse theme: for lore muse, the bard also gains a +1 status bonus to all Lore checks; for maestro muse, the status bonus to Performance checks increases to +2 for the purpose of determining the effects of compositions; for polymath muse, the bard gains a +4 status bonus to untrained skill checks; and for all other muses, the Will save bonus increases to +2 against fey. Nymph’s Beauty (aura, emotion, enchantment, mental, primal, visual) 30 feet. Creatures that start their turn in the aura must succeed at a Will save or suffer an effect described in the nymph queen’s entry. Tied to the Land A nymph queen is intrinsically tied to a specific region, such as a forest for a dryad queen. As long as the queen is healthy, the environment is exceptionally resilient, allowing the nymph queen to automatically attempt to counteract spells and rituals such as blight that would harm the environment, using her Spell DC with a counteract level equal to the highest-level druid spell she can cast. When the nymph queen becomes physically or psychologically unhealthy, however, her warded region eventually becomes twisted or unhealthy as well. In that case, restoring the nymph queen swiftly heals the entire region."
Duergar,"Deep beneath the surface, duergars stubbornly claim the ancestral subterranean homelands of the dwarves as their own, having refused to venture to the surface along with their modern dwarven cousins. An exiled dwarven deity named Droskar offered duergars salvation from the horrors of the Darklands, and in exchange duergars endlessly toil in his honor within their subterranean empire. Notorious slavers, duergars regularly raid other Darklands settlements as well as surface communities in constant search of living beings to task with endless amounts of work in their harsh and exhausting settlements. Duergars are gray-skinned creatures, often referred to as “ashen” by those surface dwarves willing to speak of them. These subterranean dwarves have a strong natural connection with cave-dwelling vermin, and it’s common to see duergar caravans drawn by teams of immense beetles. Most duergars devote themselves to the worship of Droskar, a taskmaster of a god who demands back-breaking toil in addition to regular prayer. Duergar leadership often consists of powerful divine servants of Droskar, along with incredibly stout warriors whose martial prowess ensures they can overcome any direct threat to their rule. Almost every aspect of duergar society is controlled by a strict hierarchy of leadership, with taskmasters directing subordinates across all walks of life."
Solifugid,"Giant solifugids are monstrous vermin with six legs and two large feeding appendages easily mistaken for an additional pair of legs. They are often called camel spiders, sun spiders, or wind scorpions, despite the fact that they are neither spiders nor scorpions."
Eagle,"These large birds of prey swoop down from incredible heights to snatch fish and small mammals in their powerful talons. Eagles nest atop high trees or steep cliffs that provide a commanding view of the surrounding area. They avoid nesting too near civilization, but some remote cultures train eagles as hunting companions."
Sphinx,"Sphinxes are a family of mystical beings that combine leonine, avian, and usually humanoid features. Though the most common sphinxes are famous on their own merits, the family includes other types of sphinxes as well."
Elder Thing,"Known by various names on various worlds, but most often as “elder things” or “old ones,” these alien creatures are interested in creating lasting works of art, architecture, and even life (such as the legendary and dreaded shoggoth). Matched with their boundless capacity for egotism and enormous life spans, elder things often see themselves as the most learned and advanced species on any planet they visit, and tend to treat most other forms of life like a scientist might treat experimental stock. While not generally inimical or violent, their nature often puts them at odds against other societies they encounter, and war is a time-honored solution. The elder things rarely shy away from using violence to secure their own territory and their perceived right to experiment and explore. A typical elder thing is 6 feet tall from head to foot, with a 7-foot wingspan. Their bodies are radial in nature, with five wings, five tentacle-like arms that each end in a writhing nest of tendrils, and five eyestalks. At one end of their barrel-shaped bodies are several larger tentacles they use for combat and locomotion, while at the other, at the center of their five eyes in their starfish-shaped heads, sits a single mouth surrounded by multicolored cilia. An elder thing's language is a mix of piping and whistling sounds, but they can vocalize a wide range of other languages as well—albeit with a strange, high-pitched accent."
Wyrmwraith,Wyrmwraiths rise from the souls of dragons who refuse to accept death or have an irrational fear of the afterlife.
Eel,"Although these long, narrow fish share similarities in appearance, eels are a diverse group of creatures."
Elk,"Powerful and swift land mammals, elk range through the plains, hills, and forests of the wilderness."
Dragonfly,"Dragonflies hunt with a combination of agile power and deadly speed. In their early life stages these insects are entirely aquatic predators, but they take to the air once they’ve molted. Most live around bodies of water suitable for spawning, but giant dragonflies have been known to fly many miles when on the hunt. Though their gossamer wings and colorful bodies are beautiful at first glance, an unwary adventurer lured in by the display runs a very real risk of becoming lunch."
Sahkil,"Dreadful creatures that stoke mortal fears, sahkils lurk on the Ethereal Plane where they slip into nightmares or dark places of the world to torment the living 
"
Harrowkin,"When a harrow deck becomes infused with great magical power, it can produce a harrowkin. Harrowkin Abilities Each harrowkin is connected one specific harrow suit and has the following shared abilities. Defensive Suit When the harrowkin attempts a saving throw connected to its suit—that is, Fortitude (Hammers or Shields), Reflex (Keys or Books), or Will (Stars or Crowns)—if they roll a success, they get a critical success instead. Read the Cards  [free-action]  (divination, occult) Trigger The harrowkin is about to roll initiative; Effect The harrowkin attempts to rewrite destiny. Roll 1d6 to determine a suit.

Shuffle the Deck  [free-action]  (divination, occult) Frequency once per day; Requirements The harrowkin has rolled initiative; Effect At the end of the current round, all creatures currently in initiative reroll their initiative, using the same modifiers as their original initiative roll, and use the new initiative values for all following rounds."
Facetbound,"Inspired by the work of the Azlanti and their obsessions with aeon stones, certain necromancers strive to tap into those curious magical items to create undead with powerful abilities. A facetbound is created from a living being with an aeon stone surgically attached to their skull who is killed in a specific, secret ritual. Each facetbound must bear a single aeon stone, and this stone determines the powers the facetbound wields (in place of the normal powers of the implanted stone)."
Fox,"Elusive and shrewd, foxes have gained a reputation as sly tricksters, earning them a place in many folk tales."
Herexen,"A herexen is an undead heretic, driven by hate to destroy the deity they once served. Herexens choose their faith willingly in life, rising to become respected religious figures within their church. Shortly before or during their death, they lose faith in their chosen deity so completely they become a full heretic, blaspheming, committing atrocities, and cursing their god. These anathemic acts bind their soul to their flesh, causing them to rise as cursed beings. To a herexen, faith is the ultimate lie. Although the circumstances that drive a pious worshipper to break with their faith are varied, herexens are unified in purpose. Herexens spend their existence fighting their former god in every manner they can, destroying iconography and temples, slaying worshippers, banding together with other herexens who oppose the same deity, conscripting lesser undead, and hiring living proxies to wreak havoc or spread misinformation. A particularly motivated herexen may even plot to kill or unseat the deity they once revered. Curiously, herexens maintain a corrupted form of their divine powers after death, wielding the weapons and magic of their past faith to tear it down."
Mosquito,"While the common mosquito is a pest capable of spreading deadly diseases, their giant kin and the ravenous clouds of mosquito swarms are even more dangerous."
Fetch,"A fetch is a twisted, deviant simulacrum of a humanoid creature that exists or existed at one point on the Material Plane. Rumors of fetches that are reflections of entities from other planes persist, but none of these tales speak of fetches that duplicate anything other than a sapient source. A fetch can manifest spontaneously when a powerful creature undergoes a significant emotional event or dies, either while on the First World or while in an area significantly influenced by the First World, but one can also be created by significant forces like the Eldest in order to torment and vex those who have annoyed them. While a fetch manifests from a soul's “reflection,” and as such bears a striking resemblance to that creature's appearance in life, a fetch has no true memories of its own. It keeps fragments of false remembrances from its source as if it experienced them in a half-remembered dream—which ensure the fetch is enraged by and jealous of its source. A fetch is similar in appearance to the creature whose soul spawned it, save that it often displays fey-like features such as pointed ears, plantlike elements, or supernatural grace. A fetch who seeks to impersonate a still-living source must disguise these features, and takes care to manifest its fetch weapon as one known to be wielded by its target. When a fetch dies, it and its manifested items fades away into a bloom of plant life, its soul instantly recycled into the First World, leaving behind a patch of weeds and thorny flowers roughly in the shape they held in mockery while alive."
Fetchling,"The people known today as fetchlings are a distinct ancestry descended from generations of humans who became trapped ages ago on the Shadow Plane. No longer human at all, these people, who call themselves kayals, have become monochromatic in coloration, with flesh tones and hair colors varying between white, black, and all shades of gray. Their limbs are lithe and willowy, and their eyes are generally solid yellow, yellow-green, or white, though a rare few have a purple or blue glow. Fetchlings have developed their own complex societies in the Shadow Plane, often under the tolerance of or in servitude to the strange, malignant creatures there, such as the sinister velstracs or the enigmatic d’ziriaks. While individual fetchlings can be any alignment, they are all survivors in a harsh environment, which leads to a tendency toward pragmatism. Fetchling clothing mimics the regions they dwell in, with drab colors tending toward darker shades. When they trade with humans or other societies on the Material Plane, they often wear masks or concealing clothing to hide their appearance. Typical fetchling communities are insular and swiftly close ranks in the event of an intruder. Though individual fetchlings don’t mind traveling to and blending in with other societies to facilitate trade, they often hide or even react defensively if they have their own visitors. When one considers the nature of the other denizens of the Shadow Plane, however, this tendency to assume the worst of interlopers might make sense to some. Fetchlings are not as common on the Material Plane; most of those who dwell there are loners by choice who have left their home to seek out adventure elsewhere, exiles who were banished from their homelands, or planar castaways with no ability to return to the Shadow Plane. This last category, the lost and stranded, are the most likely to be found in larger groups. In cities of significant size, one can sometimes even find a small community of a few dozen or more fetchlings living among humans, although they often do so subtly by dyeing their hair, wearing brightly colored clothing, and utilizing layers of makeup to hide their pallid complexions."
Jellyfish,"Many varieties of jellyfish drift through the world’s oceans, feeding on fish and other tiny marine creatures. However, deadly species of monstrous jellyfish pose a threat to unwary swimmers and sailors alike. Note that while jellyfish are animals, they also have the mindless trait because they lack a centralized nervous system."
Oni,"Not all divine creations are meant to live as mortals. Some spirits are created as guardians instead, tasked as protectors of elements of nature that cannot protect themselves. When these spirits accept their divine place in the metacosmos and take on such charges, they become kami. But some of these spirits are willful, obstinate, or simply rotten, railing against such demands from the gods and becoming bodiless and unable to interact with the world they can torturously still observe. Others receive such punishment simply for failing at their duty, and their despair at their condition twists them like those that began with a seed of darkness. When these spirits look upon mortal lives and become overcome with envy of the flesh and pleasure that humanoids can revel in, they form surrogate bodies of their own and become monsters known collectively as oni. When an oni manifests, they always do so in a form that parodies a specific humanoid ancestry closely associated with the oni's obsessions and envies. Giants' over-the-top personalities and sizes are likely the reason why these humanoids are the most common incarnations chosen by oni; such oni are known collectively as yai oni. Yet there exist oni associated with almost every kind of humanoid. Most oni are capable of supernaturally disguising themselves as their associated humanoid type and use this ability to infiltrate societies and seize control from within. Once established, oni typically reveal their true form and revel in dominating those they view as lesser beings fit only to serve their whims. Oni are nothing if not vain. They typically choose comely or striking appearances in their humanoid disguises—forms that are completely at odds with the ugliness of their true natures. An oni's true form is indicative of their innermost desires and always has features such as oversized teeth that verge into tusks, sharp claws, unusually bright skin colors, or a third eye in the forehead. Oni have desires as varied as those of any being, though by their nature these desires are almost always for hedonistic or destructive experiences of the flesh, typically food, pleasure, or violence."
Beetle,"Not all beetles are harmless creatures that can be easily crushed underfoot. Oversized and ravenous giant beetles can be found throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the world. They are often benign creatures, though when threatened or roused, giant beetles are quite dangerous. Their powerful mandibles and tough exoskeletons make for a challenging combatant."
Flea,"Fleas are little more than a nuisance in most circumstances, but can be lethal when they grow to monstrous proportions or gather in enormous swarms."
Formian,"Formians resemble unusually large ants with an insectile humanoid's upper torso. More powerful or influential formians are physically larger; common formian workers are roughly the height of a gnome, while the largest formians, such as taskmasters and queens, rival a giant in size. Formian society is a strict matriarchy. Though each hive's queen is theoretically independent and her rule absolute, allegiances are common, and less powerful hives often (grudgingly) defer to more powerful matriarchs."
Gremlin,"Gremlins are cruel fey tricksters and saboteurs who have fully acclimated to life on the Material Plane, finding distinct niches for their inventive destructiveness. All gremlins delight in ruining or breaking things, whether it’s something physical like a device or vehicle or something intangible such as an alliance or relationship. A gremlin’s greatest joy is watching the collapse of complex creations, preferably after the lightest and slightest, carefully targeted push from the gremlin. Gremlins tend to denigrate, bully, or even slaughter their lesser kin, particularly mitflits, whom gremlins (and many others) derisively call “mites.”"
Gathlain,"Gathlains have made a name for themselves as inquisitive and mischievous, as well as flighty and distractable. These eccentric little fey want nothing more than to explore the many wonders of the world for their own pleasure. Born of magical trees in seed pods that float hundreds of miles on the wind, gathlains are a bizarre mix of flesh and flora. Sprigs of mistletoe bloom from their back and form a delicate pair of wings. They enjoy adorning themselves with oddities found on their journeys, such as beads, pieces of fine cloth, and bits of armor. The fey see these accessories as trophies, proof of their travels, and mementos of their adventures. The typical gathlain is only 2 feet tall, but their small size doesn't deter them from seeking out and exploring potentially dangerous places. They sometimes even use their size to their advantage, squeezing through tight spaces that most would never be able to fit through. Moreover, their vine-laced wings let them reach heights many adventurers would find daunting. These traits have made them celebrated explorers whose presence is welcome in a group of travelers—so long as everyone is prepared for their nigh-endless questions. A conversation with a gathlain can feel more like an interrogation, as they care little for the comfort of others if it means they will learn something new and interesting to add to their range of knowledge. Gathlains are particularly fond of gnomes, as they feel a sort of familial attachment to their exiled fey kin, and attempt to ingratiate themselves with any gnomes they run across. Gnomes don't always return this affection and many tend to distrust gathlains, due to the smaller creatures' gossipy and flighty nature."
Ghoran,"Ghorans are sentient plants who grow in the shape of humanoids. A ghoran's body is composed of one large seed encased in rich vegetable tissue covered with dense, green rinds. In place of a face ghorans sport a bouquet of vividly colored flower petals with gaps and ridges suggesting facial features, which they can shift to express emotion. Magically created to be a delicious and nutritious food source that could adapt to hazardous environments, ghorans evolved to develop sentience, speech, and ambulatory bodies that could mimic humanoid forms and behavior to discourage predation. Ghorans find the concept of gender confounding, though some display visual gender cues to put humanoids at ease or leverage societal expectations to their own advantage."
Ghost,"When some mortals die through tragic circumstances or without closure, they can linger on in the world. These anguished souls haunt a locale significant to them in life, constantly trying to right their perceived wrong or wrongdoings."
Aukashungi,"These massive isopods are native to the Abyssal realm of Gluttondark, in the acidic oceans of the realm’s many cavern-worlds. Aukashungis are sometimes summoned to the Material Plane by Zevgavizeb-worshipping cultists, who favor aukashungis for their mindless obedience and sheer destructive potential."
Bat,"A wide range of bats dwell throughout the world. Most of these nocturnal animals are harmless insectivores, but deadly breeds of vampire bats and oversized bats the size of horses pose much more significant threats to adventurers."
Crab,"Crabs are scavenging crustaceans known for their hard shells and iconic sideways gait. They use their claws to defend themselves, hunt, and fight other crabs for territory. When confronted with threats from outside their species, most crabs prefer to flee, but when retreat isn't possible, they clamp on to their foes as tightly as they can.  Hermit crabs have hard exoskeletons like other crabs, but with much weaker abdomens. They find and “wear” shells as homes and protection, getting around with their front legs and claws. Surprisingly fierce, hermit crabs fight for new shells as they grow bigger, using an assortment of hollow alternatives as substitutes when shells of the right size can't be found."
Fly,"Giant flies are pony-sized insects that have massive compound eyes and bodies bristling with short, stiff hairs. Their lairs are notorious for the rotting meat they stockpile to lay their eggs into. Their maggot-dens are also prime breeding grounds for virulent diseases."
Squirrel,"Squirrels' ability to dart into sticky situations, extract berries or nuts from the most precarious of circumstances, and then hide their loot from prying eyes make them nature's thieves in trees. Their cute appearance—soft fur, big eyes, and fluffy tails—makes them inconspicuous and endearing, at least to some. Their reputation among humanoids is split between those who consider them cute little creatures and others who believe they're vermin. Usually no more than a nuisance on their own, they can become a dangerous annoyance under the command of a druid, fey, or other creature that practices nature magic or is otherwise tied to the natural world. With their ability to reach remote places, excellent eyesight, and adept problem-solving, squirrels can perform effective reconnaissance for druids."
Flytrap,Flytraps are dangerous creatures as eager to feed on humanoids and larger prey as they are monstrous insects.
Frog,Frogs that are poisonous or grow to monstrous size can be a menace to adventurers.
Hippocampus,"The strange beasts known as hippocampi resemble terrestrial horses from head to midbody, but on their legs, they have splayed fins instead of hooves, and in place of horses’ hindquarters, they have powerful tails resembling those of fish. Hippocampi have colorful scales ranging from pearly white to seaweed green, and brilliant ribbed dorsal sails as manes. In the wild oceans, most types of hippocampi tend to congregate in the shallows near the beds of seaweed and kelp forests that provide them with food and shelter from predators. They form huge schools to provide safety in numbers, like land-bound horses form herds. Hippocampi are highly prized by undersea societies and surface dwellers alike, as they are as easy to train as horses and serve many of the same functions, be that as beasts of burden, war-trained mounts, transportation, or as pets. Though hippocampi are able to wear barding, it hampers them considerably, so most handlers outfit them with the lightest options available. More often they are trained to pull specially designed underwater chariots or sleds. Hippocampi do not to leave the water, as they are clumsy on land, can’t bear riders while flopping about on the ground, and can’t breathe air for long. Numerous variant species of hippocampi exist, although most of them differ from the common hippocampus only in coloration. Heartier species, such as polar hippocampi, dwell exclusively in arctic waters and are best presented as hippocampi with elite adjustments."
Giant Bee,"Like their smaller counterparts, giant bees are highly territorial. Many types of giant bees construct hives in caves or abandoned buildings and are quick to attack creatures that they deem a threat to the single fertile queen, who almost never leaves the hive. Although most common in warm biomes with lots of vegetation, some giant bees live in arid or cold environments and are solitary rather than hive-dwelling."
Opossum,Few creatures have survived as long and in as many environments as the opossum. 
Rat,"Rats are a ubiquitous menace, scurrying through the sewers and on the streets of nearly every settlement the world over. Though a regular rat darting underfoot might startle or even frighten the average passerby, giant rats and rat swarms are far more dangerous."
Silverfish,"A common pest with a silvery carapace and an undulating, fishlike scuttle, the nocturnal silverfish infests homes and libraries throughout Golarion. These insects aren't typically dangerous, but their tendency to devour books and clothing often puts them at odds with larger creatures."
Skunk,"With their distinctive black bodies and white stripes or spots, skunks are instantly recognizable to most creatures. Those who catch a full blast of musk rarely decide to trouble a skunk again, as the revolting stench can linger for hours or even days. Removing the odor is difficult, typically requiring the aid of alchemy or magic."
Turtle,"These generally mild-mannered and docile creatures prefer to be left alone, but the ill-tempered snapping turtle is a notably violent exception to this rule."
Squid,"The unusual shape of these swift, voracious predators has prompted many a nautical tale."
Tick,"These blood-sucking parasites are common vectors for disease and other infections. Ticks infest all parts of the world, save for the most remote and frigid locales, and have evolved to feed on just about every kind of creature."
Toad,Nethys Note: no description has been provided for this family
Wasp,"While the common wasp poses little threat to a hardy adventurer aside from an uncomfortable sting, a large and aggressive swarm of these territorial insects—to say nothing of their oversized kin—can lay low an entire party of heroes. The wasps represented here are of the common variety also known as yellowjackets, but many other sorts of dangerous wasps exist, such as a Garundi variant that swarms in such great numbers that it can decimate entire villages, and the dreaded extraplanar hellwasps, which build their nests within the corpses of their victims."
Wolverine,Few creatures in the natural world can compare in ferocity to an angry wolverine.
Gibtas,"This rubbery, spheroid scavenger is nearly all acid-dripping mouth, with five bulbous black eyes and two powerful, gangly legs. A gibtas often forms a bond with a single other creature—usually, a more powerful aberration— and serves this master loyally, if erratically. Creatures who keep a gibtas as a pet or guard soon learn to keep it away from any important possessions they don't want spattered with acid."
Girtablilu,"Girtablilus are desert-dwelling guardians with the upper bodies of muscular humanoids and the lower bodies of massive scorpions. They are most often found defending ancient temples and religious artifacts with zealous fervor. Some believe they were created by a long-dead god millennia ago to act as guardians, but girtablilus consider the subject of their origin taboo and refuse to address the theory. Because girtablilus accept a wide range of religions and belief systems, some outsiders believe they also worship their own ancient pantheon. Instead, girtablilus exclusively revere and protect sites dedicated to deities considered lost to civilization. In this way, they act as preservers of holy practices that have otherwise been forgotten beneath the desert's shifting sands. Though girtablilus are used to explorers seeking entrance to the sites they defend, they might welcome those who earnestly wish to learn or offer reverence. A few even proudly share their beliefs with others, eager for the opportunity to preach to someone new. But girtablilus show no mercy to those who attempt to desecrate the sites and objects of their worship, or to those who would violate the tenets of their faith. Girtablilus are skilled fighters who keep trained giant scorpions as pets, and they remain unmatched when it comes to fighting in the desert. They require relatively little food or water, and they rely on their stamina to outlast their enemies. When necessary, they can stalk their quarry for days or even weeks, coordinating with their pets to drive their prey in circles. Once exhausted, few foes can stand up to a girtablilu's physical prowess—or their deadly venom."
Gnoll,"Gnolls are short, hyena-headed humanoids who dwell in warm grasslands, savannas, and arid hills. Given their appearance, their affinity for hyenas should not be surprising; gnolls share their homes, food, and even many of their own behaviors with these animals. Much like hyenas, gnolls have a notorious reputation—they are known as bloodthirsty gluttons and slavers who worship demons or other reprehensible powers. Though these rumors are often true, the behavior of gnoll clans varies widely. Some groups are composed of capable hunters who rarely clash with other humanoids unless there is a conflict over territory. Others hew closer to the unsavory stories, preferring to raid settlements and enslave innocents, snatching the fruits of others' hard labor by strength of arms and forcing their victims to perform the hard, demeaning labor necessary to maintain the brutal clan. Gnolls lack any particular reverence for the remains of the dead, which adds to their reputation as scavengers or even cannibals. They willingly eat nearly any other creature, including dead gnolls, which can evoke strong reactions from people and cultures with a strong taboo against cannibalism or desecrating the dead. To a gnoll, it is almost more offensive to not eat a dead body, no matter its origin; gnolls see no point in wasting precious meat in a harsh and challenging world. Worse still is the refusal to eat the flesh of a dead gnoll, which they consider an insult to that gnoll's memory and sacrifice and an implication that the gnoll's flesh is unworthy of consumption. In fact, they refuse to eat the bodies of particularly hated foes; particularly warmongering gnolls even spike the bodies or heads of such despised enemies on tall spears, which they place around their tribal holdings to dishonor the dead and intimidate would-be invaders. Gnoll women are far stronger and more aggressive than gnoll men and are typically considered the leaders of their hunting packs and clans. Though gnolls tend to be disorganized when it comes to practical matters or negotiations, they are extremely efficient at working together to hunt down prey or overwhelm a group of foes. Much like hyenas, they prefer to hunt in packs, and are exceptionally skilled at setting up ambushes or separating individual targets from larger groups."
Goblin,"These small humanoids have green or gray skin and large heads with wide ears. While some goblins are civilized and have worked hard to be considered upstanding members of humanoid communities, most are impetuous and vicious creatures who delight in wreaking havoc. These goblins think nothing of slaughtering livestock, stealing infants, or burning down a building purely for momentary delight. They revel in playing malicious tricks on taller humanoids, whom they call “longshanks.” Goblins are superstitious, with an intense awe of magic and a fascination with fire; goblins who master magic or fire earn great respect from their kin. Most other humanoids find it difficult to understand goblins’ outlook: they hate canines but eagerly share their lairs with so-called “goblin dogs,” they fearlessly attack larger creatures but are terrified of horses, and they despise vegetables yet consider pickles a delicacy. To a goblin, of course, these are all perfectly sensible life choices."
Ape,"While many apes exhibit peaceful or reclusive behavior, gorillas can be territorial, and the megaprimatus is especially aggressive and dangerous."
Graveknight,"When a fearsome combatant falls in battle, the warrior's vengeful spirit can sometimes fuse with their armor, creating a graveknight. Every graveknight is born of a unique warrior and has a unique fighting style and array of abilities that speak to their techniques in life."
Shark,"Sharks of all shapes and sizes have stalked the oceans, largely unchanged, since primordial times. They are efficient, ruthless predators with multiple rows of razor-sharp teeth capable of rending prey in an instant. Their uncanny ability to smell blood in the water means sharks might show up at any scene of aquatic carnage."
Nightmare,This entry did not have a separate description for the family.
Shadow,"The mysterious undead known as shadows lurk in dark places and feed on those who stray too far from the light. Those who parley with shadows, typically by keeping them at bay with a glowing weapon, may learn great secrets, for they are ideal spies.Shadow VariantsSource Pathfinder #183: Field of Maidens pg. 73 While the vast majority of shadows are humanoid in shape, shadows can appear in different forms, such as those of predatory animals or terrifying beasts. Sometimes called feral shadows, these shadows are often more animalistic and aggressive than humanoid-shaped shadows. In addition, some variant shadows have the following alternate rules that adjust the shadow stat block. These changes don't adjust the shadow's level. Darting Shadows Some shadows have taken their ability to hide in shadows to a greater level, shifting from one shadow to another with supernatural ease. Darting shadows gain the following ability. Shadow Hop  [two-actions]  (magical, teleportation) Requirements The shadow is in an area of dim light; Effect The shadow teleports from its space to a clear space it can see that is in dim light or darkness within 60 feet. A shadow using this ability is slowed 1 for 1 round after arriving at its destination. Possessing Shadows Some greater shadows develop the coveted ability to possess a body. Only greater shadows can become possessing shadows, and they can't use Slink in Shadows or Steal Shadow while using Inhabit. Inhabit  [two-actions]  The shadow attempts to possess an adjacent undead corporeal creature. This has the same effect as the possession spell, except the shadow doesn't have a physical body, so it's unaffected by the spell's restriction. Shadow Thief Some shadows gain the ability to handle objects. A shadow thief can't use Slink in Shadows or Steal Shadow while using Shadow Touch. Shadow Touch  [two-actions]  The shadow Interacts with a simple physical object, such as picking up a book or opening a door (it can't manipulate a complicated object, like a lock). It can't carry more than a single physical object of up to 2 Bulk. It must use Shadow Touch to keep its hold on the item each turn, or it drops the item at the end of its turn."
Grioth,"Planets that drift out of orbit from their stars grow cold and lifeless as they float through the Dark Tapestry. Such dead worlds are coveted by the horrific creatures known as grioths, who endure the awful cold on these wandering worlds and convert them into planetary temples devoted to the dark gods of the Elder Mythos. From these bastions of frozen darkness, grioths seek out warm, living worlds to tear away from their respective suns through forbidden rituals, a process that often takes numerous generations. A single cultist typically leads a grioth scouting party, and the group seeks out a disused or forgotten location on the fringe of rural settlements as their initial invasion point. Over several generations, a grioth settlement grows powerful and conquers the surrounding cultures, and eventually, powerful grioths descend from the stars to begin the next stage of planetary conquest. Grioths speak a language composed of trills and clicks. While capable of speaking other languages, they do so in dry, raspy voices. As grioths have wings, wriggling tails, and four-eyed, bat-like visages, many cultures mistakenly associate them with the evil Outer Planes, but they very much belong to this reality."
Grippli,"Frog-like humanoids who make their homes in the treetops of tropical jungles and forests, gripplis are uniquely adapted to their environment. Their oversized eyes give them keen vision in both light and dark, and their large toes allow them to easily scale the trees atop which they reside. Gripplis vary widely in physical appearance, their physiologies largely determined by their surrounding environment; those who live in verdant forests, for example, typically have bright green skin and red eyes. In contrast, gripplis who live in regions of rot and decay have mottled brown coloration, and those who dwell near lakes or streams may bear bright blue and orange stripes. Typical gripplis are just over 2 feet tall and weigh approximately 30 pounds. Whatever region they come from, gripplis tend to be peaceful huntergatherers. Due to their modest understanding of agriculture, gripplis don’t raise crops in the traditional sense, although they do cultivate mushroom patches and gather a wide array of fruits from the surrounding wilderness. The jungle also contains rivers and lakes filled with silver-scaled fish, which gripplis harvest in a sustainable manner to ensure their future supply, as well as fatty insects that grow much larger than in other parts of the world. Some of the most advanced grippli societies capture and breed these insects, nurturing herds of giant dragonflies or beetles that are eventually slaughtered for food for the rest of the village. Particularly enterprising gripplis even seek out and tame huge flying insects to use as mounts during their hunts. The rearing of such massive insects is no easy feat, however, so gripplis who manage to do so are often heralded as local heroes. The treetop settlements of the grippli are difficult to spot from the forest floor. Gripplis obscure their holdings with broad leaves and thick branches, and they riddle the surrounding forest with labyrinthine trails that only they know how to navigate. Their villages are usually constructed among the densest populations of trees, with thin rope bridges strung between wide wooden platforms built around each trunk."
Dog,"Dogs are trusted and loyal companions that serve as guardians, protectors, and hunting companions. Their ability to detect prey or predators via scent and their predilection to accompany humanoids makes them ideal pets for most adventurers. There are hundreds of breeds of dogs in the world—from tiny lapdogs who shower their masters in affection to muscular dogs that stand nearly 4 feet high at the shoulder—and they can be found in nearly any place where people reside. Larger breeds might even be used as mounts for smaller adventurers, and some cultures use dogs as beasts of burden capable of pulling sleds loaded with supplies across the icy tundra. Regardless, many adventurers find value in having a dog."
Hantu,"Hantus are manifestations of the powerful nature spirits that inhabit all things, from animals to objects to the environment itself. As spiritual representations of whatever they inhabit, hantus follow no preordained agenda. Some hantus choose to act as guardians, defending the forest or waterway that they represent, while others simply set out into the world and experience the wonders of life in ways that their physical form—be it a boulder, bamboo stand, or tapir—would typically be unable to enjoy. Hantus are most well known in the archipelago of Minata, particularly in the southern islands of Rendah Pulu, where animists believe that hantus manifest in locations imbued with significant spiritual power. To the residents of Rendah Pulu, hantus exist as manifestations of their culture's anxieties, fears, and ills. An individual who encounters a hantu might interpret the meeting as a sign that they have dwelt for too long on their particular worries (or the opposite: they have ignored the source of their anxieties for too long). Interestingly, although hantus are incorporeal, they still retain tangible characteristics as varied as hantus themselves. Some give off a potent odor, such as the scent of durian or jasmine. Others leave corporeal droppings, such as literal animal waste or tufts of fur left on a tree trunk.
"
Magistrates,"Magistrates are the cogs and gears that keep bureaucracy running, moving the machine along under the inertia of the status quo."
Siktempora,"In the Dimension of Time, intense emotions are more than just ethereal feelings. They accumulate over time, from things like the critical mass of emotion caused by a historic event or a settlement passing down a powerful sentiment for generations. These accretions eventually give birth to siktemporas. Each siktempora feels, with all their being, a singular intense emotion linked to the circumstances that spawned them. A rare few, however, are created when an emotionally invested creature attempts to travel to the Dimension of Time or interferes with the flow of time, which can create paradoxes or manipulate past events. Siktemporas usually isolate themselves on the Dimension of Time in mindscapes infused with the emotion that created them, but some travel to other planes. These wanderers long to indulge in more of their core emotion or to engender more of that feeling, thus perpetuating their own kind."
Hell Hound,"Hell hounds are fiendish, extraplanar canines hailing from the pit that can hunt down quarry and breathe supernatural gouts of flame. They are temperamental and quick to aggressive behavior."
Herecite,"Secreted away in the dark corners of unnamed libraries, necromancer’s dens, and heretical scriptoriums, obscure texts describe a horrifying ritual that combines sacrifice and suffering to create a powerful undead being known as a herecite. These monsters, stripped of personal will or desire, are born into the service of an evil god whom they worship unerringly and untiringly, often in spite of any opposing religious leanings they may have had in life. Every herecite harbors an unquenchable self-hatred because it was defiled by such a foul resurrection—a rage it turns outward in an attempt to rob others of their faith and lives. Herecites often outlast the cults that create them. Stranded herecites are drawn to others of their kind, even if they are dedicated to different evil deities, and when brought together they perform rites to magically bind themselves in a group known as a cabal. While cabal members share enhanced magic and defenses, induction into a cabal appears to hold even deeper significance for herecites. The presence of others of their kind with whom they can pray—in verses warped to venerate wicked gods—seems the only solace these tormented beings can find in undeath. Such a fellowship of sorrow is nigh unbreakable, as many an overzealous crusader has discovered far too late. Customarily found within heavily modified temples to the pantheon of gods they collectively worship, herecites act in service to their creators or as protectors of unholy ground. High priests of different evil gods may even trade herecites among themselves, allowing their minions to form cabals strengthened by their varied faiths. A lone herecite cut off from its creators—often because it is the sole remnant of a destroyed temple or its master has perished—may wander far and wide in search of a cabal to join. Other times, the herecite seeks out a place sacred to the deity it worshipped in life. Whether motivated by a desire for contrition or vengeance, the end result of this baleful pilgrimage is always the desecration of the holy site and the slaughter of its congregants, who may in turn rise as lesser forms of undead."
Hobgoblin,"Hobgoblins may appear to outsiders to be the most civilized of goblinkind, but their civilization is hardly one of kindness and equality—instead, they revel in all that is militaristic, tyrannical, cruel, and destructive. Hobgoblins are singularly devoted to war, and their entire culture is built upon fostering and maintaining conflict while simultaneously proving their superiority in battle. Hobgoblins are highly organized, and they work efficiently and effectively in groups, whether that group is a small raiding party, a roving war band, or a fully regimented army. Hobgoblin rulers require little provocation before declaring war, and more often than not, such wars are waged to gain slaves or territory. Physically, hobgoblins stand about as tall as humans and have gray, ashen skin. Hobgoblin society is organized along military lines, and every hobgoblin is effectively a member of the army. Each hobgoblin in a community has a rank in the military hierarchy, and individuals are naturally ambitious and obsessed with advancement. Hobgoblins are constantly expected to prove that they’re fearless, ruthless, cunning, and strong. Demonstrating such aptitudes is an individual hobgoblin’s best hope for promotion through the ranks, but failure leads only to cruel exploitation at the hands of their superiors. Though brutal, hobgoblin society is a true meritocracy, and all hobgoblins, regardless of age, gender, or birth, wield authority and earn respect from their peers based on their skill in battle. Even those individuals who serve in non-combat roles in hobgoblin society—blacksmiths, builders, cooks, messengers, quartermasters, and the like—know that they perform vital jobs that support the larger hobgoblin army, though they rarely rise above the rank of common soldier. Everyone contributes to the larger whole, ensuring that hobgoblin society is the strongest and most efficient it can be, and anyone who fails to do so is culled from the army and this hobgoblin society as dead weight. Hobgoblins don’t usually engage in trade with other races, or even with other hobgoblin tribes, preferring to take what they want by force."
Foresters,"From the managed and cultivated forests that support villages to the tree-covered crown lands where only nobles and their servants are permitted to hunt, forests provide. To communities, forests provide fuel, food, medicine, and raw materials, while royally protected forests provide food for the nobles' table and a source of entertainment in the form of organized hunts. Even the ancient woods untouched by mortal hand or blade provide bards with settings where legends happened and could happen again. Many find the forest depths unsettling, but others live their lives among the trees and alongside the creatures that make their homes there."
Lilu,Nethys Note: no description has been provided for this family
Hyena,"Hyenas are pack-hunting scavengers known for their unnerving, laughter-like cries, and they aren’t above supplementing their carrion diets with fresh prey."
Geniekin,"Geniekin are mortals whose ancestry has become entangled with that of genies, causing them to exhibit elemental powers drawn from the Elemental Planes. Though the geniekin found here are all of human descent and have example alignments, geniekin and other planar scions can descend from other ancestries and have any alignment."
Karumzek,"Karumzeks are crafty, spider-like servitors of Norgorber."
Khefak,"This unusual arthropod resembles an amalgam of a centipede and a crab. Hard-shelled and perfectly suited to life on Akiton, khefaks are so incredibly useful that a visitor to the planet might assume they were custom engineered for their environs. Such visitors would, in fact, be correct. While khefaks can be found naturally on Akiton, a new species has recently gained a foothold on the planet: alchemically engineered khefaks who excrete a refined substance that can be used as fuel to power advanced engines and devices."
Kitsune,"Kitsune are shapeshifting, fox-like humanoids who have been blessed by the spirits. They can shift from the form of a fox-headed humanoid into a specific alternate form unique to each kitsune, usually either a tailless form—such as a humanoid body without any fox features (typically of the prevalent ancestry where they grew up)—or a fox form. Kitsune revel in joy and beauty, often practicing storytelling, dance, and other creative arts. However, they also have a penchant for playing pranks on the joyless and self-important, earning them a reputation as tricksters. Favored by the goddess Daikitsu, kitsune seem to be almost supernaturally lucky, perpetually dodging danger by the narrowest margins. While kitsune settlements do exist, most kitsune are incredibly curious and often leave home at a young age to encounter new people and sights. Some kitsune spend years in their tailless form, living disguised among humanoids in urban or rural societies whose inhabitants have no clue of their true nature. Others go to the opposite extreme, spending most of their lives in the form of a fox, only to reveal themselves at the most opportune moment. For many kitsune, revealing their true form to someone is a sign of great trust, but it's also not uncommon for kitsune to display their dual nature openly. Kitsune's connection to the spiritual world grants them a number of magical abilities. Aside from their innate shapeshifting powers, kitsune naturally develop more potent magic as they mature, and they seem to effortlessly pick up skills that would rival the most practiced spellcasters. Those who truly apply themselves to honing their magic usually become remarkable at their craft. A kitsune is born with one tail, but as their magical powers grow, so do their number of tails. Elders blessed with great magical wisdom can have as many as nine, though according to popular legend, this level of power can take up to a thousand years to achieve.
"
Kobold,"Kobolds are small, reptilian humanoids who carry physical similarities to true dragons. They lurk in dark spaces, usually tunnels and mines beneath the earth, in either warrens of their own design or complexes discovered and colonized after the original builders have moved on. Though kobolds are far more pragmatic than they are courageous, they use every inch of their cunning to even the playing field between themselves and other, stronger creatures. They attack from the darkness and at range, and kobold artificers and engineers master the art of simple but effective traps, which they use to protect their lairs. Kobolds are skilled at working together by necessity, and they often set up ambushes or hit-and-run assaults that allow them to do the most damage possible without being harmed in return. Kobolds are diligent and hardworking creatures, though they often turn these virtues toward selfish ends. While some kobolds live in communal collectives that maintain neutral relations with the creatures around them, they can be easily swayed into serving malevolent powers or megalomaniac leaders. This is in part due to kobolds’ innate pragmatism, as they would rather concede to servitude than risk being killed, but it is also in part due to a reverence for the power that kobolds generally lack. Dragons in particular are viewed with a deferential awe, and kobolds eagerly offer their services to such mighty and glorious creatures when they can. While kobolds may scheme against other leaders, especially those that control them via subjugation, dragons are usually viewed with adoration, no matter how brutal they might be to their kobold minions."
Kami,"Kami are divine nature spirits native to the lands of Tian Xia, far to the east of the Inner Sea region. They serve as guardians of natural objects and places they protect—their “wards”—and are ancient enemies of the oni. Kami can merge with their wards, allowing them to surreptitiously watch anyone who treads upon their sacred grounds. Kami leave those who they deem harmless alone, but the spirits fight vigilantly to scare away anyone perceived as a threat. Kami choose their own wards, though many mortals seek to attract them to sites that might require protection, leading to a proliferation of certain trees, statues, gates, and other symbolic elements in areas where kami are known to dwell."
Kovintus,"Kovintus are reclusive humanoids with an inborn talent for geomancy that ties them intrinsically to nature. Not only can they call upon the magic of nature, it also calls to them in return, turning them into an element of the surrounding terrain when they die. One of the strongest traditions in kovintus culture is making maps to chronicle the places their loved ones have become one with the landscape. Kovintus live in small groups in natural places far from larger civilizations. A typical kovintus settlement consists of natural houses built into the environment around a central meeting place. The form fits the terrain, with dwellings nestled into crags on a mountain or forming a windbreak on a plain. Though kovintus beliefs can greatly differ based on their home terrain, many of these creatures believe their intrinsic commonality through nature links them more intimately than such superficial differences. Once, all kovintus lived in their ancient home, the Valley—a place of bounty and natural splendor unheard of in the modern world. This paradise was lost in ancient times, and the kovintus set out in small groups to find new homes. Today, any valley kovintus come upon is called merely an “echo” of the true Valley. Rather than seeking their original valley, kovintus believe the cycles of nature will someday bring about a new home with the same grandeur. Kovintus faith calls for respect rather than reverence. When traveling away from home, kovintus believe it's crucial to respect any local deities who have built the land they stand upon, and pay them tribute with small offerings."
Lamia,"Lamias are bloodthirsty victims of an ancient curse for which they blame the gods. Most lamias are humanoid from the waist up but have the lower bodies of beasts and monsters. Sinister magic comes naturally to a lamia, and they prefer the use of illusions and enchantments to deceive prey for later consumption, or simply to torture."
Cat,Few predators of the natural world can match the cat’s talent for stalking and stealth.
Grim Reaper,This entry did not have a separate description for the family.
Lizardfolk,"When human scholars speak of ancient civilizations, they usually turn their focus to themselves, researching and lecturing on the first human empires. When they drift to others, they invariably look to cultures that had conflicts or alliances with ancient humanity. That the culture of the people called lizardfolk often gets ignored or forgotten even by well-meaning researchers is thus no surprise, but to the lizardfolk themselves it is no matter. They know their history and value its integrity and privacy—if younger ancestries like humanity aren’t interested in learning from lizardfolk empires dating back to before the first human knocked two rocks together to make their first campfire, that’s fine with them. The word “lizardfolk” is an excellent example of humanity’s narrow-sighted view of this culture. The name of their people is “iruxi,” but these reptilian humanoids have patiently and good-naturedly accepted the name “lizardfolk” as a variant, and they generally resist urges to call humans and other mammalians similarly derivative names in return. Iruxis dwell and thrive in all tropical and temperate biomes, but they are most at home in swamplands, coastal regions, and riverlands, for they are talented swimmers, and fish and aquatic plants make up a large part of their preferred diets."
Locathah,"Deep in the sea, schools of locathah—piscine humanoids armed with spears and specialized crossbows—stalk sharks, sea serpents, and giant squid from the backs of their giant moray eel mounts. The first hunters to strike are armed with barbed harpoons that deploy large fans of seaweed, slowing and exhausting their prey. A daring few locathahs use the embedded harpoon as a handle to ride prey for a short time. Once the creature is tired, remaining hunters finish it with longspears. Locathahs developed this hunting tradition to forge skilled warriors and deter potential attackers, partially in response to centuries of oppression and mistreatment from other aquatic cultures. Locathahs rarely hunt land-dwellers, instead offering to trade their services as guides in exchange for metal and ceramic items they can't build underwater—and for tubers, which they consider earthy delicacies. They render aid to damaged sailing ships and rescue shipwrecked sailors, providing food and guidance. Locathah communities—usually villages of 200 individuals or fewer—are matriarchal. The ruler is also as its primary egg-layer, providing each generation with powerful familial bonds. The communities are tight-knit and loyal. Matriarchs are advised and assisted by primal spellcasters and healers, who are often accompanied by octopus companions."
Maftet,"Maftets are hawk-winged humanoids with leonine lower bodies that dwell in ancient ruins and cities thought lost, typically in desert or mountain regions. They view themselves as guardians and practice a specialized technique of dual-wielding scimitars so central to their culture that a maftet's scimitars are often cherished family heirlooms. Most maftets venerate their ancestors in addition to various deities, and even a child can detail their family lineage back multiple generations. Maftet prides tend to be matriarchal and isolationist, though maftets aren't necessarily hostile to outsiders who respect their homes and don't seek to loot them. When a young maftet comes of age, they receive runic tattoos from a pride's elder. These tattoos are imbued with magic that allows a maftet to enchant their wielded weapons, but the individualized designs tell of the maftet's ancestors, childhood adventures, and positive qualities. Such tattoos are considered sacred and never given to non-maftets."
Ray,"Rays are an unusual type of fish with wide, sail-like fins and long tails, giving them an almost kite-like shape as they swim gracefully through the water. All rays have a rudimentary form of electrolocation, allowing them to detect the faint electrical charges that emanate naturally from nearby living creatures, a sense akin to scent in its accuracy."
Paaridar,"Monks dissatisfied with the limits of their humanoid forms and yearning for a shortcut can steal the might from other creatures. These monks become paaridars, amalgamations that blend the features of their former ancestry with the form of another creature. The transformation challenges the limits of the paaridar's body and soul, demanding continual discipline to maintain control. The rituals to make this transformation were developed by Paaridus, namesake of this loose monastic order. The process requires a captive creature—a victim to draw powers from. Over days of intense rituals, the monk displaces their own chakras with those of the victim. This unnatural process transforms the ki, and thereby the body. The lower chakras are considered “safer” to replace. Most Paaridars stop at the root, sacral, and navel chakras. To go farther risks losing control of one's emotions and intellect entirely, a fate Paaridus himself succumbed to. Paaridars consider this his sacrifice and lesson, but other monks recognize that even one step on this path is profane. The creature victimized by the ritual remains—still alive, but only a husk, as the transformed chakras within leave it weak and removed from its nature."
Weasel,"Weasels are lithe, clever predators known for both their beautiful, sleek fur and their ability to crawl into tight spaces. Pound for pound, few animals are as voracious as weasels. Insatiably hungry, they eat almost half their own weight each day, leading them to constantly hunt for new prey to satisfy their hunger. "
Sloth,"Despite their long, hooked claws being one of their most distinctive features, sloths are herbivorous creatures. Smaller sloths use their claws to climb from tree to tree, seeking fruits and young leaves among the canopy. Larger species can reach up to 20 feet tall and weigh more than 10,000 pounds."
Merfolk,"Elegant, mysterious, and graceful; all this and more can be said of the merfolk. These enigmatic people resemble humanoids with delicate features from the waist up but with the fins and tail of a massive fish from the waist down. Found in nearly all of Golarion’s oceans, merfolk are as varied in appearance as humans, their skin ranging from pale to umber and all shades in between, while their gleaming scales shimmer with the majesty of the sea."
"Vampire, Jiang-Shi","Jiang-shi are terrifying hopping vampires from Tian Xia. Though similar to other vampires—they are undead, they drain vital energy from the living, and they can be slain only in specific ways—jiang-shi feast upon the breath of the living, also known as qi or ki, instead of blood. While they possess unique powers, including their magic-deflecting paper fulus, extraordinary jumping ability, and immunity to sunlight, jiang-shi also possess unique vulnerabilities, such as the inability to see living creatures save through breathsense, a revulsion to bells and mirrors, and near-stupefying melancholia. Thankfully, most jiang-shi can't create vampiric spawn.
"
Couatl,Couatls are serpentine celestials who tirelessly help mortals reach their greatest potential all across the planes. Some serve benevolent deities as intermediaries while others serve the cause of good as they see fit. 
Monkey,"Monkeys vary greatly in size, color, and behavior. Some are distinguished by bright orange fur, others for black fur in sharp contrast with a white face. Some produce distinct noises, like howls that can be heard from a village away. Others vie for dominance within ever-changing social hierarchies. Their size and aptitude for climbing allow them to quickly escape threats; combined with being a little too clever for their own good, this allows them to get up to all sorts of mischief and usually escape to do it again."
Morlock,"Morlocks originate from humans long lost to the surface world. They have an affinity for machinery, scavenging, and strange occult behaviors."
Munavri,"Although the subterranean Darklands are known for their cruel and domineering civilizations—led by fiend-worshipping drow, urdefhans, and others—that dwell within those sinister caverns, not every such subterranean society is ruled that way. Munavris are perhaps the best example of a people that tend to treat new arrivals to their Darklands territories with good temper, fairness, and respect. These humanoids are the descendants of humans who survived the world-ending cataclysm called Earthfall—mariners who were abducted by alghollthus and dragged down through the ocean depths until they emerged on the other side of the seafloor, amid the Sightless Sea in the lightless realm of Orv. Gradually, munavris' bodies adapted to their new home: they lost the pigments in their hair and skin, developed highly sensitive vision, and began to demonstrate telekinetic powers. These early munavris eventually settled on a mysterious archipelago of jade islands—mystical green landforms that seemed to resonate with strange, psychic energies that repelled their alghollthu captors. Safe from their abductors and nurtured by the strange powers of their jade islands, munavris have remained free to hone their telekinetic abilities into substantial psychic prowess. Every munavri has the ability to concentrate psychic energy upon an object to immediately ascertain what it is and how it works. Such natural intuition doesn't come easily, though; using this power requires the munavri to expend a large portion of their limited psychic energy. Sleep is the only way for a munavri to replenish this psychic well. Today, nearly all munavris dwell on these islands and ply the waters of the Sightless Sea. Their predominant culture promotes nobility of both deed and heart, and many munavri dedicate their lives to waging war against those who sew discord in the Darklands."
Munsahir,"Munsahirs build militaristic, traditional societies."
Mana Wastes Mutant,"The erratic magical energies of the Mana Wastes can warp and twist creatures foolish or unlucky enough to be trapped in them. The physiological effects of this exposure vary in scope from grotesque full-body transformations to more subtle changes to the skin or senses, and they're frequently accompanied by changes in disposition, motivation, or temperament."
Nagaji,"Nagaji are brawny bipeds with humanoid figures and serpentine heads. Their bodies are covered in tightly layered scales that range in color from green to brown, and almost all nagaji have a colorful ridge along their head and back. Ophidian eyes lend nagaji an imperious visage, with irises that span every color of the rainbow. Nagaji physiology varies somewhat. Some possess vestigial tails, while others have sharp claws, and some even sport impressive fangs that can inject a simple venom. Like snakes, nagaji are cold-blooded and reproduce by laying eggs; as a result, nagaji territories rarely overlap with those of mammalian humanoids, since their environmental needs diverge so widely. They're a hardy and strong people, but their close ties to nagas mean many have the potential for powerful magic, as well. Long ago, the naga goddess Nalinivati created the first nagaji as the backbone of a society that respected nagas. But the nagaji were never mindless vassals, and the goddess gifted them with free will. Many nagaji willingly serve nagas to this day, honoring some as outright divinities. While outsiders might regard nagaji initially as brainwashed servants, nagaji dispute this claim. Of course there are evil and unfair naga overlords, but there are just as many fair and just naga rulers, and nagaji history remembers various rebellions and revolutions when a matriarch overstepped her bounds to support a new naga's claims of rulership. Nagaji accurately note that their long history with nagas is no simple matter and claim that the partnership goes both ways: nagas rely as much on nagaji for the running of their empires as nagaji rely on nagas to lead their people to prosperity. Although nagaji might be encountered in diverse cities and urban centers, their communities are concentrated in environments that suit their biology, namely jungles and tropical forests. Where many species would languish in the heat and humidity, nagaji bask in the warmth and thrive."
Darvakka,"Darvakkas, also called nightshades, are a ravenous evil made up of equal parts darkness and malice. Originally creatures of the Outer Planes who travel to the convergence of the Shadow Plane and the Negative Energy Plane—where the power of nothingness obliterates them—these undead abominations are the physical embodiment of entropy. They burn with an intense hatred for all life, working to bring a final, dark night to the Material Plane where nothing but ash and ice remain. As creatures twisted by darkness and shadow, darvakkas have a great aversion to sunlight and all sources of positive energy. On the Material Plane, they spend the hours of daylight hidden below ground, amid ruins, or submerged deep in the ocean's darkest chasms beyond the reach of the sun's rays, emerging when darkness shelters them overhead. Darvakkas have an aura of entropy that attracts undead thralls to serve as warriors and heralds. They rarely seek alliances with each other or other creatures, existing in solitude as the heads of individual armies of the dead."
Necrohulk,"The strange, terrible energies swirling about on the winds and embedded in the earth of the Mana Wastes have led to unexpected changes and mutations in the bodies of those who dwell there. These mutants usually have little chance to escape their hardscrabble existence, as they're ostracized by other societies. People in the kingdom of Nex to the north look on such folk with suspicion, as do the dwarves of Alkenstar to the west. Surprisingly, the undead nation of Geb to the south is often the best hope for a future among people with unusual appearances. Those who flee to Geb or are convinced to make it their home frequently find their welcome to be a false promise, however. Necromancers who long ago tired of animating the same humanoids find new potential in mutated flesh, and mutants who aren't careful might find themselves led into laboratories or crypts for experimentation. Enterprising twilight sages of Yled's Mortuarium have innovated bizarre combinations of alchemy and necromancy that boost their victims' mutations to persist even after reanimation. Although these necrohulks are virtually mindless and require a constant influx of chemicals to retain their might, they're more than powerful enough to make the extremely difficult process worth the effort. The cartridge containing the alchemical formulation that sustains them is perhaps the trickiest part of necrohulk animation, and it's easiest to simply stitch the cartridge right into the necrohulk's flesh. Yled's armies contain a growing number of necrohulks. This isn't solely because these juggernauts are frightening effective combatants on the field of battle; leveraging the instinctive revulsion that mutants create carries some strategic advantage. Although the occasional necrohulks do run amok in Yled, addled on the chemical cocktails that sustain them, military necromancers generally keep them under control."
"Vampire, Nosferatu","Among the most ancient of vampires are the nosferatus, twisted remnants of mortals who died in great plagues of old. Perhaps because of their age, nosferatus can no longer create more of their kind. Yet they still lurk among the living, manipulating the hearts and minds of their prey to either serve them beyond the limits of natural life or to become sustenance for the nosferatu like so many others before."
Gorga,"Gorgas are fey embodiments of diurnal creatures' fear of the dark. Beings of shadow and hunger, they love to prey upon light-loving creatures. Many different kinds of gorgas exist, and each embodies a different facet of the night's countless terrors. Gorgas are common in the First World realm of Nighthold, where they once served the mysterious Count Ranalc. After Ranalc's disappearance, the gorgas quickly lost what little compassion they had, scattered into small bands led by their strongest members, and began hunting any fey they could find. All gorgas carry shrouds of shadow within them, and most find daylight unpleasant, tending to remain within Nighthold's perpetual gloom or hole up in caverns or deep forests until night falls. Their bizarre eyes—hollow pools of magical shadow—allow them to see even in magical darkness."
Ogre,"Ogres embody brutish, amoral violence and cruelty. Standing 10 feet tall and densely muscled, ogres are as strong as they are cruel. Ogres are sadists that enjoy remorseless murder, torture, degradation, and mutilation in all of its forms. Although they prefer to vent their violent urges on smaller humanoids— the smaller and more beautiful, the better—ogres promise a horrifying fate for anyone unlucky enough to fall within their meaty grasp. But for all their creativity in developing methods of violence, ogres often remain too dim-witted to realize that their playthings lack an ogre’s robust fortitude and high pain tolerance, so most captives die far sooner than the ogres might prefer. Such a fate is perhaps preferable however, as those who survive too long as ogres’ playthings suffer lasting mental scars from the horrifying abuse. A captive able to keep their wits can sometimes trick the brutes by promising treasure, meatier captives, or other crude amusements, taking advantage of an ogre’s limited intellect to engineer opportunities to escape. Ogres are social creatures only in the most debased sense. They gather together in groups called families, though members are not always related by blood. Ogres practice incest regularly, believing that it makes for stronger familial bonds, and most ogres are misshapen or mutated from generations of inbreeding. The most powerful ogre in any family is the “boss”—usually the family’s patriarch or matriarch—while other ogres in the family learn to obey or risk being brutalized by the boss’s loyal kin. Ogres lair in caves, crumbling ruins, or dilapidated shacks close enough to humanoid settlements or animal trails to make raiding easy. These lairs are filthy and frequently contain all-too-recognizable evidence of their depravity."
Orc,"Orcs are violent, monstrous humanoids that live by the rule that might makes right. They amass in brutal warbands both large and small, decimating and robbing those unlucky enough to cross their path. Countless small settlements, outposts, and forts have fallen at the hands of orc raiders, whose fecundity and sheer destructiveness leave an indelible mark on the lands they conquer. Survivors of orc invasions are as likely to be fed to the orcs’ war beasts as they are to be taken as slaves. Unspeakable atrocities await any outsiders brought back to orc encampments, and to many, death is a far more preferable outcome compared to capture by orcs. Physically, orcs tower over most humanoids and look practically custom-made for violence with their rough flesh, sturdy bone, and iron-hard muscle. For all their tough looks, however, orcs are far from invincible. They lack the discipline to conduct large-scale campaigns, for one thing, and they typically lose their heads in the heat of battle. Even their skin scars easily—though this is a source of pride to the orc people, since scars signify strength and experience in battle. To orcs, the crisscross of old wounds are a much a badge of pride and honor as any beheaded foe or claimed trophy. Orcs are a people of violent passions in all that they do, not just war. Bonds of blood are especially strong among orcs, and lineage is important. The strongest orc bands are typically made up of brothers and sisters in more than arms; orcs fight harder when they are protecting their own kinsfolk, and orc warriors will fight tirelessly to avenge fallen family members. This emphasis on bloodlines is not an altruistic one, however, and is in fact a double-edged sword. Orcs whose families have been killed find themselves at the bottom of the clan’s totem pole, and even a famous chieftain can become powerless overnight if their brethren aren’t there to back them up. The chaotic and fractious nature of orc culture results in a great variety of beliefs, superstitions, and legacies among different clans. This cultural divergence causes substantial infighting among orc bands, in many cases preventing the rise of larger orc nations. It can also frustrate many attempts at diplomacy, as the taboos of one band may be commonplace and thoroughly accepted practices among others. Navigating a specific band’s culture can often mean the difference between life and death to those who deal with orcs off the field of war. Although orcs, as a rule, rarely deal with outsiders, they recognize the benefits of trade and willingly swap resources with other violent peoples like hobgoblins, drow, and many humans."
Owb,"These ancient denizens of the Shadow Plane appear as grayish humanoid torsos covered in translucent funeral veils of shadow. Silent and mysterious, they float about, absent legs to hold them aloft. Never speaking a word aloud, they instead reach into the minds of creatures around them to whisper and mumble curses, threats, and strange bits of forlorn augury. These haunting creatures are revered by calignis as proxies of the Forsaken—a strange array of ancestor-like demigods whom many calignis worship. Some even believe owbs are the Forsaken manifested. A multitude of owbs visit and even remain to advise caligni communities, as varied in personality as the Forsaken. All owbs share a hatred of light and color, except for the flickering glow of the burning cold magic they can hurl as a weapon. Owbs who live among calignis tend to prohibit the use of light and color, using their curse of darkness to quench violators if necessary. The only other similarity across all owbs is their entrenched desire to manipulate their charges through mind-reading and deception, though such manipulation can be either subtle or overt."
Owlbear,"With the body of a powerful brown bear and the keen senses of an owl, the owlbear is a dangerous territorial predator, fearlessly attacking any creature that strays into its domain. Those who run afoul of an owlbear hear its terrifying screech only seconds before the massive creature is upon them, ripping them apart with deadly talons and a powerful beak.
"
Skelm,"Rage-filled skelms are drawn to any settlement with more than a few hundred souls. Using magical disguises and leveraging societal norms to their benefit, these antlered monsters crave fearful respect and brutally punish any who dare disagree with their lofty opinions, even in the slightest degree. Although quite dangerous on their own, skelms are at their deadliest when leading an angry mob. Their cruel and exploitative nature has made their name synonymous with villainy. An existing skelm can transform any evil humanoid who's overwhelmed with rage into one of their kind. Skelms heap enraging humiliation on potential new brothers as a form of indoctrination, convincing these recruits that some other person or group is responsible for their misery. This practice ensures skelms begin their new existence with sufficient vitriol to plot their revenge. Many newly forged skelms carry on their lives in the roles they held as mortals; and in fact, these roles often shape the type of skelm they become. Skelms can arise among members of nearly any ancestry, though they're more common among cultures with deeply entrenched gender roles, unjust hierarchies, and those that don't offer healthy ways to experience and process anger."
Revenant,"A revenant is a vengeful undead who stalks the one who killed them in life. They're relentless in the pursuit of their murderer, seeking a final justice. The revenant presented in Bestiary 2 is just one variant of this undead. Others can be found, each varying by the circumstances of their death."
Phantom,"The typical trajectory for souls passing to the afterlife is fairly straightforward, according to most theologians. When a mortal dies, their soul enters the River of Souls and eventually reaches the Boneyard, where it is judged by Pharasma. The judged soul moves onto its appropriate domain of final rest—Heaven, Hell, Abaddon, and so forth—where it becomes a petitioner. Complications arise, however, when a soul in queue for judgment prematurely departs from the River of Souls and is shunted into the Ethereal Plane. Whether as a result of nefarious interlopers like night hags, malignant planar magic, or even fate, these souls become dislodged from the natural order of life and death and linger in a sort of purgatory. Unlike petitioners, these ethereal phantoms retain memories of their life before death, and unlike spirits such as ghosts, phantoms aren't tinged with the foul influences of undeath—at least, not at first, though the threat of corruption hangs heavy over a phantom's existence. Some eventually succumb to that fate, while others eventually rejoin the River of Souls. Until then, these wandering souls are a kind unto themselves—one without a true home, agenda, or purpose. Many phantoms have no desire to remain in their strange state of purgatory, either because they seek to continue their journey through the River of Souls or because they fear the corruption of undeath. In order to complete the natural spiritual cycle and become judged so they can continue to the afterlife, a phantom must simply find a way back into the River of Souls. Such a quest is no easy feat, however—the hazy mists of the Ethereal Plane can befuddle even the most experienced traveler, and numerous predators prowl the realm in search of stray souls to bind or devour. Creating Phantoms Phantom creatures have statistics similar to those they held as physical beings. You can turn an existing living creature into a phantom by trading their usual traits for the ethereal, incorporeal, and spirit traits. Their Strikes gain the magical and force traits (and the finesse trait, for melee Strikes) and deal force damage instead of their original damage type. Phantoms gain immunity to disease, paralyzed, poison, and precision damage and resistance to all damage (except force or ghost touch; double resistance vs. non-magical) from being incorporeal. Many phantoms gain occult innate spells or special powers related to the Ethereal Plane, such as those described in the stat blocks on these pages. If you give a phantom more than one new ability, consider increasing their level and adjusting their statistics to match."
Fish,"Swimming in vast shoals through open ocean underneath the sparkling sun, lurking deep in the muddy beds of rivers, or schooling in pristine lakes, fish are found nearly anywhere there is water."
Mosasaur,"The massive swimming reptiles called mosasaurs thrash their powerful tails to propel them after prey. Four articulated, webbed paddles let them precisely steer their paths, and their hinged jaws—much like a snake's—allow mosasaurs to swallow larger creatures than their size would indicate. A small set of secondary pterygoid jaws in their gullets pull in their meals for more efficient digestion. As air breathers, mosasaurs must stay near the surface of the water, competing for food with whales. This proximity to the surface means they often capsize small boats, feasting on the crew members who fall out. "
Risen Pet,"Bonds of loyalty that endure beyond death reanimate pets to crawl from their graves within days of dying, returning to the side of their past owners, family, or pack. Unfortunately, death irrevocably changes a risen pet. They return as aggressive, predatory beasts, difficult to control and easy to anger. Even the most friendly and docile of pets becomes sadistic and violent in undeath— fixating first on those it views as competition for the attention of its owners. When a risen pet is jilted, rebuffed, or offended by its owner, it turns on them."
Bandersnatch,"Bandersnatches are consummate hunters, and only the deadliest predators or the most cunning intelligent prey offer them sport. A bandersnatch resembles a tawny, six-legged, earless great cat, but with wickedly barbed quills running the length of its body and down to the tip of its long, flexible tail. It measures 40 feet in length plus another 10 feet of tail and weighs 12,000 pounds."
Pterosaur,"Pterosaurs are primitive flying creatures. While many are smaller than a human, the two presented below are quite a bit larger. Each of these creatures could pose a serious threat to a person. These flying reptiles can be found in a wide selection of regions, but they tend to soar above warm or temperate climates."
Sluagh,"A soul about to leave its physical body gives off a peculiar scent, usually unnoticed by mortal creatures. But the undead fey called sluagh can smell and track down its location with frightening ease. Unlike most fey, sluagh are undead, possessing strong connections to negative energy and mortal souls. Sluagh collect the souls of those close to death and bring them to feed their queen. Most sluagh appear bald-headed, with rounded ears, sharp teeth, glossy black eyes, and scrawny bodies. Their rib cages show through their skin, which is translucent and soft as velvet. Sluagh can become ghostly and incorporeal for brief periods. They use this power to stalk their prey to great effect. Sometimes the glimpse of a sluagh is mistaken for a ghost sighting."
Ratfolk,"True to their name, ratfolk are rodent-like humanoids well suited to living on the outskirts of mainstream society. Despite common misconceptions that they are dirty or diseased, ysoki, as they call themselves, keep impeccably clean. Ratfolk are also sometimes mistaken for wererats and initially treated with fear until they can correct the mistaken identiflcation—if they get the chance to do so. In general, ratfolk have a keen understanding of pathological and alchemical sciences, which they employ in trade and self-defense. They make accomplished alchemists and tinkerers, and they often protect their lairs with traps, bombs, and other creations. Ratfolk merchants regularly dispatch large trade caravans that travel widely for a year or more before returning to their home community. During this time they make an effort to learn new things from the people they encounter and collect new, interesting materials and goods that they can bring back to their warrens. In their warrens, on the road, and in cities, ratfolk are extremely communal, thriving on proximity to and contact with one another even in relatively tight spaces. In addition, ratfolk are excellent at fighting in cramped spaces alongside their kin. Threatening one ratfolk or their allies is a sure  re way to rally the whole community."
Raven,Few birds are as cunning and social as the raven.
Ravener,"Though their lifespans can measure in millennia, all dragons must eventually perish. While many do so on the blades or under the spells of dragonslayers, some manage to outlast their enemies and must, in time, face the truth that awaits all living creatures at the end of their natural lifespan. As with many other creatures, some dragons respond to such looming reminders of their own mortality poorly, and the particularly prideful or wrathful of their kind often lash out in anger when confronted by this grim truth. Peace and acceptance may find some dragons, but the most stubborn of their ilk (and invariably the most wicked) may pursue a different answer to the problem. These dragons seek out sinister rites that can transform them into undead creatures known as raveners. A ravener’s flesh is stripped away as part of the transformation, leaving only their skeleton. What they lose in flesh, however, the dragon gains in soul-rending power, as their raw spiritual energy forms a protective barrier around their skeleton, keeping it intact and allowing flight with now-skeletal wings. This new existence is not so easy to maintain as other forms of undeath, however, and the ravener must feed regularly on the souls of living creatures to power their profane metabolism. This hunger is much greater than that of a living dragon, so raveners are forced to relocate regularly, traveling to fresh hunting grounds each time they strip their current home of prey. A ravener may depopulate whole regions at a time in order to sate their endless hunger for souls, lest they lose much of their power and become a ravener husk."
Rhinoceros,"This hefty animal is easily recognizable by the distinctive upward-thrusting horn on its snout. Rhinoceroses are herbivorous and, in spite of their hulking size, can run at considerable speed. While rhinos have good hearing and a keen sense of smell, their eyesight is relatively poor."
Horse,"Horses serve as mounts and beasts of burden in many societies. They are loyal and typically gentle creatures, and they are invaluable to those looking to travel long distances. Smaller folk, like gnomes and halflings, often utilize ponies as mounts, while horses are the favored steeds for humans and other Medium humanoids. Most horses that the average humanoid encounters are domesticated, though large herds of these powerful animals can be found in the wild."
Ram,"Rams are sturdy, stubborn herd animals suited to rugged terrain and cold weather. Regardless of their territory, all share a stubborn nature and surefootedness, navigating uncertain terrain with ease and weathering all seasons in scattered herds."
Samsaran,"A unique connection to the cycle of life and death defines the mortal lives of samsarans. With a tendency toward reclusiveness, samsarans have delicate builds, enigmatic and pupilless eyes, and blood as clear as water. When a samsaran dies, their body vanishes and their soul instantly reincarnates into a newborn child elsewhere on the same plane: usually another samsaran, but occasionally a humanoid of a different ancestry. Though all samsarans have an innate understanding of their nature, they consciously remember little from their former lives. Some, however, are occasionally struck by disjointed memories or flashes of déjà vu linked to a previous existence that can earn them a reputation for preternatural wisdom and insight. Most samsarans prefer to lead studious lives filled with moments of deep reflection. Their sights remain set on the eternal and on enlightenment, reducing the appeal of the short-term material gains one can achieve in just one lifetime. A samsaran ceases their cycle of reincarnation only upon reaching perfect state of enlightenment—or falling so far from harmony that they proceed to a doomed afterlife. The ancestral home of the samsarans lies in Zi Ha, a remote mountain nation in Tian Xia. These treacherous mountains help ensure the solitude most samsarans prefer, and they're further protected by misguiding illusions, defensive wards, and secure fortifications."
Saurian,"Enormous tyrannosaurus-humanoids, saurians are ancient beings who predate the rise of humans and dwell in the world's primeval jungles. While the saurians presented here are evil, saurians of all alignments exist."
Sea Devil,"Sea devils are horrid, amphibious humanoids who lurk in Golarion’s oceans and crawl ashore to steal away victims beneath the veil of darkness. When an entire fishing village disappears overnight, sea devils are the first suspects. Far from mindless monstrosities, sea devils are terribly intelligent, with a cunning limited only by their strict adherence to hierarchy. They call themselves “sahuagin” but have wholly embraced their enemies’ name for their kind as their own. Their cultural militancy enables sea devils to act in concert to perform grand acts of sabotage, marauding, and pillaging, and only the strongest (and most conniving) members of the tribe make it to the top of the social ladder. For all their discipline, however, sea devils are widely known to snap into murderous frenzies at the scent of blood. Even the best-laid plans can fall apart when a sea devil breaks ranks to revel in the spilled blood of their victims, an indulgence that can quickly cause a chain reaction of bloodthirsty ecstasy throughout an entire raiding party. For this reason, sea devils typically capture landborne quarry using nets and ropes, dragging them to the depths of the sea before making even a single incision. Among sea devil society, individuals are rewarded based on their performance during hunts and shore excursions, with rebels and outliers quickly culled from the ranks. Every pup is given a fair chance, however, and even the lowest-born sea devil can strive for the rank of commander, general, or perhaps even king or queen. Sea devils in positions of leadership tend to be among the largest, most violent, and most calculating of their kind, and fully realized sea devils are skilled warriors capable of capturing entire villages on their own. The most powerful sea devils are mighty kings and queens who coordinate the activity of lesser sea devils across territories spanning leagues, foiling attempts at their positions via manufactured blood feuds and wars against their numerous enemies ashore and underwater."
Verdorite,"When disaster befalls the natural world, a different kind of undead may rise, entirely unlike risen humanoids. Most plants, fish, insects, and other animals don't possess a psychology complex enough to experience the emotional catharsis required to return as undead without intervention from an outside force. Mass extinction can serve as that outside force. Humanoids clear-cutting an entire forest or a seaside community wiping out a species critical to their ecosystem can spawn a verdorite. The collective spiritual energy and emotional distress of a dying biome powers these undead, formed as conglomerates or representatives."
Seugathi,"The wicked, alien neothelids impregnate themselves through ritualistic magic to produce wormlike servitor creatures called seugathis. These creatures spawn with a strong psychic drive to complete some task on behalf of the neothelids' far-reaching plans. These directives are diverse, strange, and usually cruel toward humanoid life."
Shabti,"Cobbled together from broken bits of mortal souls, shabti are facsimiles of wealthy or powerful mortals seeking to escape punishment for their sins upon death. Those rulers and nobles afraid of Pharasma's judgment use the shabti to receive cosmic punishment in their stead. Unaware that they're copies of another soul, shabti endure this fate for some time before being discovered by Pharasma's psychopomps, who reveal the truth to the shabti and strive to met out the avoided punishment to the shabti's creator, using whatever information available. In this case, the shabti is liberated and left to wander Golarion on their own. Freed but without purpose, many shabti try to recreate the lives that they think they were supposed to lead, replaying out the themes and situations from false memories that fill their heads. Others find themselves tormented for ages by the fact they were solely created to endure punishment for sins committed by another. Some shabti revel in the freedom of their new endless existence, traveling the world in search of sensation and meaning. A rare few shabti find purpose in aiding Pharasma. They seek to do justice in the god's name and preserve the natural order. Some follow this path as repayment for being freed, while others want to ensure that others don't suffer in their creators' stead."
Shanrigol,"Fleshwarpers, regardless of their origin or training, create a shocking amount of waste. When the discarded remnants of aberrant flesh are heaped together with an accidental mixture of alchemical compounds or odious energy, the mass can quicken and regain life. Without the guidance of a fleshwarper, these aberrant body parts form into a shanrigol, a mess of bone, muscle, and sinew."
Shobhad,"These four-armed humanoids often live as nomads on Akiton. Self-sufficient and able to construct the equipment they need to survive from natural materials, shobhads traditionally avoid large cities and the smaller people of the planet, except to engage in trade. Some shobhads eschew these traditions, finding life in urban centers to be more appealing. Rifts between these shobhads and those who continue to lead nomadic lives in the Akitonian wilderness sometimes lead to clashes when members of the two societies meet. Shobhads are highly sought after for their martial expertise, unparalleled knowledge of Akiton's wilds, and unbreakable codes of honor. These warriors may operate independently, in their traditional clans, or in modern mercenary companies that blend ancestral traditions with the needs of modern military freelancers."
Shoony,"Shoonies are reclusive humanoids who resemble bipedal dogs with wrinkled faces and bulging eyes. They predominantly dwell in the grasslands and hilly plains of the Isle of Kortos. Shoony societies on Kortos are known for their agricultural prowess, industrious work ethic, and skill with tools to shape their environment. Shoonies have a rich oral history and claim that their kind flourished all around Kortos in the days when the living god Aroden walked among them. Many shoonies believe that Aroden himself personally created the shoonies after he raised the island from the bottom of the sea, and that he had a deep affinity for their people. Whether or not such tales of companionship with the god of humanity are true, shoonies have drastically declined in numbers since Aroden’s death over a hundred years ago. Shoony elders point to strange environmental phenomena around their island home as one cause of their diminishment, and others attribute their decline to the rise of warmongering monsters in the area. In a world where might often makes right, it is hardly a surprise that the peaceful but timid shoonies are becoming increasingly rare."
Siabrae,"A siabrae is an abomination. A skeletal druid or wild witch, with bones the texture of stone and antlers of rock rising from their rough skulls, they're people who have willingly paid the ultimate price to protect the natural world. It rarely goes well for them. Druids and wild witches protect Golarion's environment from a host of threats—demonic invasions and undead horrors, otherworldly corruptions, and mundane greed and cupidity. Sometimes, they're tested beyond what they can bear, faced with forces they're incapable of defeating. Such a druid, seeing everything they have protected fall to destruction, might try the unthinkable. They might perform the ritual known as Welcome the Blighted Soul. With desperate prayer and a gory blood sacrifice, the druid becomes a siabrae, taking the corruption of the land into themself and binding both together, so they might survive and fight monsters in nature's service. A small few are able to use their newfound power to save their lands, and so the ritual's legend grows. Much more often, the druid becomes a twisted guardian of something past saving, the land they protect a macabre parody of healthy nature. Most siabraes are proud and bitter, obsessed with duty and branding their living brethren as cowards and traitors."
Skin Beetle,"Skin beetles are found in most environments that can sustain life, from cold, dry steppes to dense, humid jungles. They use their complex multi-jointed mandibles to strip the skin and flesh from recently deceased creatures with almost surgical precision. While skin beetles eat most of what they remove, they also preserve chunks for later by coating it in special salivary secretions similar to formaldehyde. The skin beetle rolls this coated flesh into a ball, then stores it under an exposed tree root or rock for leaner times. Signs of skin beetle activity include excoriated skeletons and the smell of the beetles' preservative saliva."
Sporeborn,"When a mindless guardian is needed, but the ethical bounds of creating undead are too uncouth, ritual casters may turn to a more fungal solution by creating a mycoguardian. Using valuable parasitic fungal spores, a ritualist may seed the corpse of a creature and encourage them to grow, sending mycelium tendrils throughout the body. The tendrils bond to mobile tissue such as bones, while replacing tendons with reinforced mycelium. This ritual magically replicates the yellow musk creepers' ability to spread throughout a dead organism then mobilize its body. But rather than a completely mindless fungal carrier, the ritualist has some control over the infested creature's behavior. The magic of the ritual includes basic instructions and rules that guide the new fungal mycoguardian (in this case, a sporeborn). Simple instructions like “guard this room” or “slay all of the tiny creatures in this basement” should work well enough, but complex commands such as “deliver this letter to the Harbormaster of Caliphas” are doomed to failure."
Sportlebore,"The bane of hungry adventurers the world over, sportlebores are nefarious vermin that resemble delicious snacks. When positioned near trail rations such as fruit or jerky, a sportlebore can flawlessly imitate these foodstuffs by flexing, contorting, and color-shifting its abdomen, then folding its thorax, head, and legs into hiding under its delicious-looking body. Once consumed, the sportlebore reproduces into a hungry swarm that is regurgitated by the now ailing eater, ravenously attacking any creatures it thinks it can consume."
Spriggan,"When the gnomes first emigrated from the First World so many eons ago, some found the Material Plane so strange and terrifying that they lost their sense of joy. Seeing only the threat of the new world and none of its wonders, these gnomes grimly resolved to survive no matter what the cost. Their innate magic responded to this goal by twisting them in mind and body over the course of many generations, eventually transforming them into the creatures known today as spriggans. Love, happiness, and beauty have no meaning for nearly all spriggans, for their minds have long since abandoned the capacity to understand and enjoy such positivity in the world. Violence, malice, and distortion have expanded in spriggan society to fill the aching voids left behind by their ancient expunging of positivity. Today, the best a spriggan can manage in place of positive emotions is a muted satisfaction when they make another creature suffer. Spriggans resemble muted, hairless gnomes with oversized, pointed ears and an alien, feral appearance. Many of them are gaunt and haggard. Skin tones vary across all different shades of blue, from a pale sky color to a deep midnight. Unlike their more cheerful and optimistic kin, spriggans do not become afflicted by the bleaching, a fact that many of their kind smugly hold up as proof that their ancestors’ choice to abandon joy was the right one. While spriggans can specialize in a wide range of skills, one feature they all share is the capacity to transform into lumbering, hulking incarnations of their normally small frames. By drawing upon the void left behind in their souls, they reflect the anger and cruelty in their minds and physically transform into giant versions of themselves akin to ogres in stature; however, this rage-induced change takes a toll on their bodies. The longer a spriggan remains in giant form, the more pain and agony they have waiting for them when, inevitably, they revert to their true size. Yet this promise of pain does not deter a spriggan from using their power to grow in size, for it’s only when they assume gargantuan proportions that they can truly feel joy and satisfaction. That spriggans feel these emotions only when they are bullying smaller creatures, fighting enemies (or even allies), or inflicting pain on victims speaks to the depths of their corruption."
Stheno,"With living snakes for hair, sthenos, who are descended from medusas, are a curious and independent ancestry. A newly emergent people, sthenos have existed for just barely over a century. Only a few generations have passed since their genesis, and some adult sthenos remember members of the original generation. Indeed, since sthenos can live about as long as humans, a few of the original sthenos might yet live somewhere. As a people without a traditional homeland, sthenos seek to find societies that welcome them, which can be a challenging endeavor. With more than a passing resemblance to medusas, given their ophidian hair and striking features, they find most places are wary if not outright hostile to their presence. All sthenos descend from a single woman of the same name. Stheno rebelled against the poisoned gift of nightmares that the goddess Lamashtu granted her sisters, the powerful medusa matriarchs known as euryales. Stheno prayed to Shelyn, goddess of art and love, for help in overcoming her twisted birthright. Eventually, Lamashtu's power struck Stheno down, but Stheno's remaining faith and will imbued each of the hundred snakes from her hair with a mind and will of its own. Each snake grew into an individual stheno, and a new ancestry was born that day. Sthenos have been slowly spreading across the land, their numbers growing as they can have children with humans. In these families, children of all genders are born either fully human or fully stheno, seemingly at random. Sthenos with a welcoming community to call home tend toward large families with many children, perhaps from some survival instinct as early members of a new ancestry. Sthenos, unsurprisingly, have a great love for snakes, and they tend to keep other snakes as pets and companions to their hair. Stheno hair snakes are non-venomous and love to eat insects within their reach. They are semi-autonomous, though their behaviors are colored by the stheno's emotions. An angry stheno might find their snakes lashing out at the subject of their wrath, while an amorous stheno's snakes might just want to snuggle instead."
Guardian Beast,"Stone statues of beasts can often be found paired and standing guard to either side of an entryway. While some seem like merely lifeless statues, others are far more than they appear to be. Guardian beasts ward against evil and misfortune. Some of these celestial spirits were assigned this task, while others assumed their roles out of a sense of duty. To allow them to maintain a constant presence in the material world, pious artisans carve stone vessels of the beasts in their likeness; these statues then serve as anchors for the guardian beasts' souls. Should the need arise, guardian beasts can merge with their stony form, becoming a dangerous foe with noble courage, an indomitable will, and few weaknesses. By day, guardian beasts stay in their vessels and pretend to be inanimate. Past nightfall, they might patrol the grounds in their stone form or leave the heavy vessel behind to go where a solid body can't reach. Some take this chance to visit the dreams of individuals they favor and send them messages, notifying them of strange occurrences or warning them of incoming danger. Despite their good intentions, the dream messages from guardian beasts can be obscure, often overshadowed by the spirit's personality or strange assumptions they make due to their nature as resolute guardians. While guardian beasts can work alone, they usually appear in bonded pairs who complement each other in nature. One could be a jokester, the other gloomy; another could be nurturing, the other strict. To make two otherwise identical-looking beasts distinct, sculptors often depict one stone animal with their young. In the case of stone lions, a common type of guardian beasts, this approach means carving stone lion cubs to accompany one of the guardians."
Strix,"Strix are avian humanoids with sprawling, dark-feathered wings and large talons. Strix possess angular features and piercing eyes that are fixed facing forward. Their lurching head movements and vertical eyelids give an unnerving quality to their humanoid appearances. Strix, called itarii in their own language, live in tightly bonded roosts nestled into the cliffs and treetops of Golarion's highest elevations. Their societies mostly share a communalist, tribal structure, each led by a female leader called a rokoa. Their dwindling population, combined with the adversity they face, promotes interconnectedness and empathy, even between different tribes. By contrast, strix face an ageless conflict with the human populations that surround their home at Devil's Perch, forced to fiercely defend their ancestral territories against human incursion. As a result, strix distrust humans on sight, though these grudges typically don't extend to human offshoots, such as half-orcs and half-elves. Oral tradition tells that the strix who live among the spires of Devil's Perch, an area in the southwest region of Cheliax's Menador Mountains, were banished there by a massive storm as punishment for an ancient, forgotten transgression. Strix communities debate whether this curse still haunts their people. Those that believe so cite the endless bloody conflict between the strix tribes and the nearby humans, who regard the strix as winged devils to be purged from their territories. Due to strix's deep emotional connection to each member of their tribe, any strix life taken by human hands leads to swift retaliation, which humans use to paint strix as monsters. This cycle of retribution, along with continuous loss of strix land, has bred generations of hatred."
"Zombie, Tar","The victims of a tar ooze eventually emerge from the ooze's vast, viscous bulk to walk again as mindless zombies. A tar zombie is unmistakably dead: much of its skin, muscles, and internal organs were consumed by the tar ooze and have been replaced with globs of tar. No vestige of the original creature's mind remains, but the zombie walks by slowly pulling one sticky limb from the ground with each halting step. Unless a necromancer or powerful undead creature takes control of the tar zombie and commands it otherwise, it typically follows the ooze that created it. Over many months, a tar ooze can acquire many such attendants that crowd around, watching for prey. Some evil and intelligent individuals have found tar zombies useful as guardians or minions. A villain eager for necromantic minions but unable to animate their own might create an army of tar zombies by imprisoning a tar ooze and feeding it a steady diet of victims."
Terra-Cotta Warrior,"Terra-cotta warriors guard the tombs of ancient rulers, where they stand vigil, animating only when intruders break in to pilfer riches or defile the tomb itself. Each warrior is meticulously crafted from clay and given unique features."
Terror Bird,"Terror birds aren't one species but rather a family of deadly, flightless avian predators. All terror birds are capable of bursts of great speed and have powerful beaks that can tear apart the flesh of their prey. Most stalk large, open prairies and steppes, competing directly with other sizable predators such as large cats and wolves."
Tooth Fairy,"Tooth fairies spawn when a child's tooth (or, less commonly, an entire child) is buried in terrain rife with fey energies. Hatching from the buried teeth like larvae from an egg, tooth fairies build crude pliers from whatever they can find, then go hunting for more teeth—regardless of the owners' willingness."
Trilobite,"Often overlooked as little more than water-dwelling pests, trilobites are a varied species of arthropods found throughout the seas and oceans of Golarion. So ancient and widespread are these critters that trilobite fossils are as commonly found as living specimens."
Urdefhan,"The violent warmongers, occultists, and poisoners known as urdefhans dwell within the Darklands. They were created in eons past by the mysterious First Horsemen of the Apocalypse to serve as agents of the end times within the Material Plane. Urdefhans continue to honor their creators by worshipping the wretched beings who rule over the plane of Abaddon, and like their fiendish lieges, urdefhans exist for one reason and one reason alone: to kill. While urdefhans are humanoid and dwell together in large groups, this is where their similarities to surface ancestries end. Their visages are horrific, with transparent skin and musculature displaying their glistening entrails, gleaming bones, and perhaps worst of all, their baleful red eyes. This, combined with their gaping maws full of sharp fangs, works to create the false impression that these beings are some sort of vampiric undead, not creatures of living flesh and blood. When an urdefhan’s life comes to an end, their flesh quickly curdles and then bursts in a wave of awful corruption that spreads to the flesh of other creatures in the area. The typical urdefhan views their eventual demise as a disappointment, for once they’re dead, their chances to kill will finally come to an end. Urdefhans’ primary concern is death and how to inflict it in the goriest, most painful, and widespread ways. Beyond this ethos of violence, urdefhans concern themselves only tangentially with matters such as formal modes of warfare or aspects of their damnable religion. When an urdefhan is not actively engaged in violence, their giddy cruelty is tempered only by a sense of self-preservation that ensures they survive long enough to spread the “blessings” of their daemonic patrons. They pass the time between wars inventing new weapons, developing new diseases, and researching awful new magic, all in preparation for the next inevitable conflict."
Vampire,Vampires are undead creatures that feed on the blood of the living.
Vanara,"Vanaras are monkey-like humanoids who dwell in treetop villages high in the canopies of lush jungles and verdant forests. Like the monkeys they resemble, vanaras manifest a wide variety of different fur colors, body types, and facial features, but they all have in common long, dexterous fingers and toes, as well as nimble and curious minds. Many of them learn to use their tails to capably manipulate objects. Vanaras are a friendly people, but their boundless curiosity and love of pranks has a tendency to strain their relationships with other humanoids, and thus they usually make their homes far from urban areas. The majority of vanara settlements are found in southeastern Casmaron, among the lush jungles where they first originated. Devotion to monastic training and magical study has led to secondary populations forming in the Impossible Kingdom of Jalmeray, eastern Katapesh, and northeastern Nex. Nonetheless, young vanaras seized by wanderlust may roam far across the world, and travelers from many distant lands may in turn visit vanara communities in search of the wisdom of their elders and sages. Vanara culture prizes order and discipline, leading to many vanaras studying monastic practices. They also value compassion, kindness, and community, whether that community is their own or one they're visiting. Most vanaras are quick to offer aid to those in distress and rarely hesitate in the face of evil, no matter the danger it presents. The leaders of vanara villages tend to be religious figures, or occasionally others possessing similar values and experience. Vanaras venerate Ragdya, the Sage of the Mountain, who encourages seeking enlightenment through worldly action and sees the virtues of pranks and humor."
Xiomorn,"When Sairazul created xiomorns, they were immortal. She created 65,536, all in her own image, and all imbued with a piece of her divine spark. During her imprisonment, Ayrzul used visions of a future extinction to manipulate them into sacrificing their power to him. This sacrifice split xiomorns into two classes: 32,768 vault builders who kept Sairazul's essence and 32,768 vault keepers who would live forever no longer. For millennia, xiomorns built a vast, magical civilization across the Plane of Earth, and when there was no space left to build, they left. On each new world, xiomorns build their vaults and conduct their experiments, endlessly searching for clues to help them avoid their extinction."
"Vampire, Vetalarana","Vetalarana vampires feed on the emotions, thoughts, and memories of others. Although they are capable of feeding on animals, beings of the planes, and other intelligent undead, only the thoughts of an intelligent, living humanoid bring a vetalarana any sense of satisfaction. Slender and pale, with sunken cheeks and exceptionally long nails, vetalaranas become flushed with color and life after feeding on particularly potent emotions and thoughts, enabling some to pass as living for a short time. A vetalarana is created when a person with psychic or occult abilities dies in denial of their death, refusing to pass on to the afterlife but unable to retain their grip on life. As their spirit has no cause left undone nor debt to settle, these tenacious souls rise not as ghosts but as vetalaranas, a formidable and tenacious mind animating their own corpse in a mockery of life. A vetalarana's predations inevitably turn their victims into living husks, incapable of thought and devoid of any spark of personality. These victims fall into a senseless stupor, comatose but still living, without identity or memories. If a vetalarana is killed, they can occupy one of these comatose husks, while more powerful vetalaranas can control them like living puppets. When a vetalarana is destroyed, all of their comatose victims are immediately freed. Most often, these people regain consciousness as amnesiacs whose memories return over time—taking at least months but sometimes as long as decades. These returned memories are fragmented and often jumbled with the thoughts of others the vetalarana fed upon. If a victim served as a failed host or was frequently controlled while comatose, a sliver of the vetalarana's corrupted thoughts remain in the victim's mind. These tainted victims recover much faster than their fellows, regaining their memories in record time and transforming into a new vetalarana soon after."
Vilderavn,"In their true form, a vilderavn is a great raven with a wingspan of 6–8 feet. Adaptable shapeshifters, they can change to the fighting forms of a snarling wolf, a hybrid of both wolf and raven, and a tall humanoid in black armor with a massive greatsword. More sinister is their ability to assume a humanoid guise suited to insinuate themselves into the retinues of boastful mortal rulers. With historical knowledge and clever rumor-mongering, they goad the proud into squabbles, feuds, and ultimately wars. The vilderavn stays at the ruler's side until victory is within grasp, the war almost won, then exacts the cruel stroke of betrayal. Their magic turns the mortals against each other, and the vilderavn's sword falls swiftly."
Virulak,"When a creature dies from poison, it sometimes rises as a virulak: an undead being infused with lethal venom. Most virulaks are solitary creatures with memories of an excruciating death. Occasionally, a mass poisoning produces numerous simultaneous fatalities, increasing the chance of many virulaks arising at once and working together in a dangerous mob. Entire villages might rise as virulaks when forced to subsist on food so spoiled it has become toxic or from an intentional scheme to poison the settlement. Virulaks retain the intelligence and memory they had in life, but their agonizing death by poison transforms them into bitter mockeries of their former selves. Poison seeps from their fingertips and solidifies into hard claws. Virulaks are known for a cynical and ironic sense of humor. They delight in poisoning the good spirits and reputations of those around them, dealing psychological blows that mirror the venom in their bodies. Virulak Abilities All virulaks carry lethal poison in their bodies, described by their undead virulence ability. Virulaks usually have one of the following additional abilities (each stat block presented here already has one of these abilities included). You can give a virulak multiple abilities, but you should increase the virulak's level if you do. Envenomed Weapons A virulak's poison is supernaturally channeled through their weapons. Any target hit by a melee weapon wielded by the virulak is exposed to the virulak's undead virulence. Fetid Breath  [two-actions]  (divine, evocation, poison) The virulak exhales a deadly poisonous cloud in a 15-foot cone. The cloud deals 1d6 poison damage plus 1d6 poison damage for each level of the virulak to all creatures in the area, which must attempt a basic Fortitude save (using a high DC for their level). The virulak can't use Fetid Breath again for 1d4 rounds. Intensify Toxin  [two-actions]   (concentrate, divine, poison, transmutation) The virulak targets a creature within 30 feet that's currently subject to a poison affliction. That affliction becomes virulent until it's cured. Lingering Ichor  [reaction]   (poison) Trigger The virulak takes piercing or slashing damage from a melee Strike; Effect The virulak squirts a jet of poisonous ichor from the wound. The creature making the triggering Strike takes persistent poison damage equal to the virulak's level. Venomous Gaze  [two-actions]   (concentrate, divine, necromancy, poison, visual) The virulak locks its gaze on a single creature within 30 feet. The target is exposed to the virulak's undead virulence.

Vishkanya,"From a distance, vishkanyas share more than a passing resemblance to humans. However, a closer inspection reveals ophidian eyes with gold or white coloring, a forked tongue, and tiny, smooth scales set in serpentine patterns atop their skin. Even so, most onlookers assume these features to be an indicator of tiefling heritage or draconic magic, never suspecting how truly unusual the subject of their speculation is. Among outsiders, little is known of the vishkanya ancestry other than that a vishkanya carries a potent venom within their blood and saliva, knowledge which has led to widespread fear and distrust. To avoid persecution, vishkanyas entrench themselves deep into their chosen societies and train in the arts of subtlety. Drawn to work that allows them to put their skills to good use, vishkanyas often take the roles of spy, mercenary, bodyguard, and even assassin. Some of the best-known guilds in the world employ vishkanyas, including the paired Assassins' Guild and Poisoners' Guild of Daggermark in the River Kingdoms, the implacable Red Mantis Assassins, and the famed Grand Sarret academy for courtiers in the Impossible Kingdom of Jalmeray. In most cases, these employers know their employee's true identity, but not always. Due to the measures they must take to ensure their survival, vishkanyas don't congregate openly. Instead, they meet in secret, creating support networks and advisory bodies. Leading these gatherings are the most respected of vishkanya women, who work diligently to keep their ancestry and traditions alive. These underground communities are slow to spread, and leaving them means abandoning what little social and cultural support a vishkanya has. As a result, very few vishkanyas have emigrated from their Vudran homelands into the Inner Sea region or other lands."
"Vampire, Vrykolakas","Wicked and vengeful souls denied even the most basic burial rites can rise again as vrykolakas, blood-drinking and plague-bearing reanimated corpses. They spread suffering and death among all who cross their paths, punishing all who remind them of those who failed to properly lay their bodies and souls to rest."
Warg,"The warg is an intelligent and malevolent wolf that dwells among goblins, hobgoblins, orcs, and other violent humanoids."
Wayang,"In hushed tones, superstitious people tell their children stories of wayangs— living shadows who come out at night to eat misbehaving children. Mostly, these stories are just fictions of fearful minds, but it's true that wayangs were originally creatures of shadow, straddling the edge between light and darkness. The ancestors of modern day wayangs set out on a great exodus some 10,000 years ago, leaving their native Shadow Plane to seek out a new home. On Golarion, they found a great cataclysm had blocked out the sun behind a cloud of smoke and ash, enshrouding the planet in a seemingly endless night, and here they made their new home. When the light returned, wayangs retreated into what shadowy places they could find, avoiding contact with humans and other peoples of the light, who viewed the small, gaunt beings as suspicious reminders of difficult times. Many wayang groups are nomadic, though many other groups have sedentary communities. Some live in homes carved out of natural caves, where they create works of art from stalagmites and other natural features. Others live in treetop villages in rain forests where sunlight barely penetrates the thick canopy of the forest. Wayangs are most populous in southeastern Tian Xia, especially in the archipelago of Minata, also known as the Wandering Isles, but their travels can sometimes take them to even further lands. Despite their sinister reputation and secretive nature, wayangs are joyous creatures who tell stories and express their emotions through whisper-singing, dancing, and shadow puppetry, enhancing their performances with shadow magic. Similarly, they weave shadow magic into their deadly fighting styles, but wayangs are not a violent people, usually fighting only to protect what's theirs. Wayangs decorate their stringy hair with beads and their dusky skin with tattooed white dots that form pictures, with each picture silently telling stories about their family's history or their worship of various deities of shadow."
"Werecreature, Wereant","Insectile werecreatures, such as wereants, only come about in unusual circumstances, such as powerful curses from inhuman gods or transformative magic run amok. Wereants work together with a natural cohesion that's rare in other types of werecreatures. The wereants presented here are more powerful than most wereants, as they've been warped by the forces contained within the Vesicant Egg."
Werecreature,"Werecreatures are humanoids doomed to transform into animals and animal-humanoid hybrids under the light of the full moon. These shapechanging creatures are the result of an ancient primal curse that they can, in turn, transmit through their own bites. Their ability to lurk unseen in the wilds as well as among people, combined with the contagiousness of their condition, makes werecreatures a perennial cause of panicked suspicion.Afflicted and True Werecreatures Werecreatures come in two types: those afflicted with the curse and those born with it (“true werecreatures”). One can be born a true werecreature to any werecreature parent. A true werecreature is always a werecreature and retains the same memories and most of the same statistics in all forms. A true werecreature also has full control over its shapechanging except during the full moon, when the transformation is irresistible. There is no known way to break the curse on a true werecreature. Affected werewolves received their curse from the bite of another werecreature (which could’ve been an afflicted or true werecreature). An afflicted werecreature may be unaware of its curse because it retains no memories of its transformations, gets no benefit from being a werecreature when not transformed, and has no conscious control over its transformation. An afflicted werecreature’s curse can be removed like any other."
Wild Hunt,"Although some believe the wild hunt is nothing more than legend, the riders of the wild hunt are real. Countless members of these fey compose the wild hunt—the term “wild hunt” refers to the family of creatures as a whole as well as to individual groups of these fey who gather to pursue their quarry. Wild hunt monarchs set the terms of each specific hunt, depending upon the prey and their own whims. The easier the prey, the more likely a monarch is to impose rules to make the hunt more entertaining, such as forbidding anyone but their hounds from injuring the quarry, or holding back their forces to give the target creature time to rest and recover. While most missions come from rumors gathered by a wild hunt monarch, monarchs occasionally consider proposals from the few who are brave and knowledgeable enough to seek them out. They accept tasks only from sources they deem worthy, and the payments they demand for their services vary significantly, though they have no interest in material wealth. Wild hunt monarchs take grave offense at unfavorable deals. Those who attempt to cheat a monarch often become the enraged fey's next target."
Worm That Walks,"When a powerful spellcaster with a strong personality, a lust for life, and a remorselessly evil soul dies and is buried in a graveyard infused with eldritch magic, a strange phenomenon can occur. The decaying body fattens and instructs the very worms that feast upon it. These grave worms thrive not only on the consumption of the spellcaster’s dead flesh, but on their corrupt memories and magical power. The spellcaster’s very soul is consumed in this vile process, only to be split apart into fragments that inhabit each of the individual worms. The result is a hideous hive mind of slithering life known as a worm that walks—a mass of worms that clings to the vague shape of the body that granted it this new existence and can use the powers and magic the spellcaster had in life. A worm that walks retains memories of its life as a spellcaster before its death, but it is not undead—it is a hideous new form of undulant life."
Wyrwood,"Originally created as sapient magical servants, wyrwoods reclaimed the means to make more of their kind from their oppressive originators; now, they fiercely defend their freedom and autonomy. These small, nimble living machines rely on their wits and speed to evade foes and gather information. Most wyrwoods are precise and calculating, to the point that many outsiders perceive them as unfeeling, but they're also highly curious and passionate about matters that pique their interest. Regardless of personal agenda, wyrwoods prioritize the survival of their people above all else, even to the detriment of others when necessary. Despite gaining their freedom, wyrwoods struggle to establish a home in Avistan. Some Avistani still view wyrwoods as tools of a secretive cabal, while others consider them traitorous servants who turned on their creators. Fearing for their safety, many wyrwoods fled the Inner Sea region to create a new home in Arcadia. In the coastal city of Segada, wyrwoods live in relative peace and safety, but they still prefer insular lifestyles. Given their extreme self-reliance, wyrwoods have learned a degree of adaptability that far surpasses that of other cultures. When a wyrwood community finds itself in need of a specific skill or function, a member of the community—either a volunteer or one selected communally—takes it upon themself to learn the required abilities. They don't view any task as lesser or demeaning, as hubris is foreign to a wyrwood's construct nature. A wyrwood's soul is tied to the magical stone that serves as their heart, which sometimes survives even when their construct body perishes. Another wyrwood might take the surviving heart from a close companion and incorporate it into their own body. In some cases, multiple wyrwoods might live on in a single body."
Xulgath,"Reptilian humanoids who live in the uppermost reaches of the Darklands, xulgaths (known as troglodytes to many surface-dwelling folk) often attack intruders in their territory on sight. They live in simple familial communities, battling rival groups and other aggressive Darklands inhabitants in order to survive. They occasionally raid surface settlements, usually at the behest of cruel, bloodthirsty leaders who are often themselves in the thrall of more powerful creatures like nagas or demons. A typical xulgath has dull gray, dark gray, or ashen scales, with a long tail and bony protrusions that run the length of its spine. A typical xulgath is 5 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. Although today the xulgaths are brutal and scattered, they were one of the first intelligent humanoids to rise in the primeval world, once ruling over a mighty empire that stretched throughout the Darklands. Today, all that remains of this era are ruins of massive stone ziggurats and crumbling cities found within some of the larger caverns. Some groups of xulgaths continue to live among these ruins, venerating their ancestors’ accomplishments, while others consider these areas taboo and leave them to become infested with Darklands vermin. Sages don’t agree on why the ancient xulgath civilization fell. Some suspect it was the result of a loss of several wars waged against serpentfolk, while others suggest that the corruptive influence of demon worship rotted their culture from within. Certainly, many xulgath settlements continue to worship demons to this day, paying homage and offering live sacrifices to terrible creatures from the Abyss. Occasionally, a xulgath shaman can call forth and bind a lesser demon to help serve the group, but a shaman who delves too deep into occultism might summon a more powerful fiend that either tears the xulgaths to pieces or enslaves them."
