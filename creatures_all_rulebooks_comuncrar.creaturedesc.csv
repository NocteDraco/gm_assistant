Aapoph Serpentfolk,"Aapophs possess greater strength and stronger venom than their zyss kin, but they lack zyss' intelligence and innate magic. Unlike their selfish superiors, aapophs are communal and group together to hunt, wrestle, and sleep curled together in pits. Though they're looked down upon and insulted by zyss, most aapophs lack the higher brain functions to recognize when they're being insulted, much less plan or execute a rebellion. Aapophs often have unusual physical mutations—horns, vestigial tails, or spines protruding from their scales—yet these variations have little impact on their overall combat prowess— and combat prowess is the measure by which zyss judge them.",Serpentfolk,3
Aasimar Redeemer,"Mortals whose ancestry has been influenced by celestials are known as aasimars, and angelkin, who have blood of angels coursing through their veins, are among the most common type of them. Many angelkin seek adventure as a means of doing good in the world.",Planar Scion,5
Abandoned Zealot,"Once devout followers whose faith proved false, abandoned zealots return from the doorstep of the afterlife after being denied the eternal reward they expected. Consumed by self-loathing for the lives they squandered to false faiths and empty creeds, these lost souls serve as terrifying and implacable—yet ultimately pathetic—foes. A shapeless mass of smoke and shadow coils behind their broken masks. As abandoned zealots move, they spit and shriek a hateful cacophony of bitter lamentations and anguished weeping. Abandoned zealots are most commonly associated with the church of Razmir, which upholds a mortal wizard as a god—a truth unknown to most worshippers. However, abandoned zealots might arise from a true religion if they've been misled about that faith's true tenets or aims. This situation could easily result from the cruel schemes and predations of sinister beings, such as shrine skelms and the blasphemous devils known as deimavigga.",,6
Abrikandilu,"Wrecker demons, also known as abrikandilus, despise beautiful things and do everything in their power to destroy both people and objects regarded as such. An abrikandilu forms from the souls mortals who were vandals, misanthropes, or defacers of artwork, particularly if their destructive actions stemmed from feelings of powerful envy. An abrikandilu loathes only one thing more than beauty: their own visage. The mere sight of their face—reflected in a mirror, a shield, or even a pool of water— can send a wrecker demon into a rage. Many demon slayers leverage tactic to their advantage, venturing into battle with polished steel shields and cold iron blades at the ready.",Demon,4

Adachros,"When a nascent demiplane fails to coalesce, its quintessence sometimes collapses into an adachros, a dangerous entity that combines overwhelming mental potential with no exposure to alternate viewpoints. Some of these megalomaniacal beings are tyrants, creating illusory kingdoms populated by abducted creatures forced to validate the creator's views. A more altruistic adachros might seek out pupils to reeducate and advise—though often without their consent—while always pushing their students to accept whatever unique philosophy was involved in their creation. An adachros might abandon disciples who spurn them, but more often, they become a bitter enemy, intent on destroying the perceived heretics.",Ennosite,13
Adamantine Golem,"Crafted from a nigh-indestructible metal of great rarity, adamantine golems can’t be destroyed except by the most powerful foes. Crafting an adamantine golem requires a quantity of adamantine so massive that collecting it usually requires mounting a mining expedition to a distant planet, the Plane of Earth, or an Outer Plane.",Golem,18
Adept,Adepts have unlocked only the most minor occult mysteries of the universe. A few are chosen by accomplished practitioners for further training. Others volunteer to join a cabal by passing an initiation ritual.,Mystics,-1
Adhukait,"Twice as disciplined as a monk and twice as deadly as a warrior, an adhukait is the ultimate perversion of duality, two spiked asura warriors impaled together to form one ferocious, incredibly efficient killing machine. An adhukait's two heads, two hearts, and two minds rarely work as one—except to maim or kill. Even adhukaits' origin contains not one but two stories. Some believe they were created when two godlike brigands attempted to raid a celestial hall and had their bodies crushed together and thrown down from the heavens. Another legend states two asura twins once challenged a great warrior to duel them in turn. When they attacked him together, he was so enraged he slammed one into the other so hard that they were fused together from that day forth. Adhukaits are among the most elite asura warriors, making up for what they lack in spellcraft with sheer viciousness and single-minded pursuit of inflicting pain.",Asura,7
Adlet,"Adlets dwell in the farthest, harshest reaches of the Crown of the World. At first glance, these isolated people look much like their Erutaki human cousins; they typically have terra-cotta skin, straight black hair, and compact, powerful builds. However, adlets tend to be taller and more sinewy than their human kin. Up close, adlets' strangeness reveals itself—each sports a maw full of wolflike teeth. Their legs and tail resemble that of a dog. Adlets' legends say that long ago, a mighty hunter lost his way far from home and came upon a house of whalebone and ice. A woman dressed in white fox furs greeted him, fed him, and tended to his frostbite. In time, they married and had 10 children, five of whom bore the legs and tails of foxes. These children stayed with their mother, while the other five—born with the legs and tails of wolves— traveled with their father back to the human lands and became the first adlets. Adlets aren't inherently evil, but their culture is warlike, xenophobic, and noticeably lacking in humility. They see themselves as the natural rulers of the arctic wastes and view everyone else as squatters at best and invaders at worst. A typical adlet is stronger and faster than any mundane human, with the ability to walk naked in a blizzard and call up ice-cold mists. Given that, it's little wonder that adlets have developed something of a superiority complex. Still, while adlet raids are a common problem for travelers in the Crown of the World, a handful of wily and intrepid merchants have forged peaceful relations with certain adlet communities along more common routes.",,10
Adult Black Dragon,"Murderous tyrants of marshes, swamps, bogs, and fens, black dragons terrorize their domains with intense fervor. Gleefully sadistic, they rule their fetid principalities from a deep cave or otherwise isolated part of the swamp with a mix of lightning-quick raids and subterfuge. Their hatred for other creatures is as acidic as their breath weapons, and they rarely tolerate even other dragons of their kind—except perhaps to mate or temporarily collaborate to take down a mutual enemy. Black dragons are amphibious—although they breathe air, their gills also allow them to breathe water. Their frills and fins make them accomplished swimmers, well suited to their wetland environments and submerged lairs. They’re immune to the fetid water that comes as a result of their magical ability to corrupt water. Black dragon lairs are as foul as their souls. The floors are littered with rotting meat, and plundered treasures line the muck and slime of their dank caves amid twisted roots and creepers. Such places are often crawling with pests, snakes, and slimes. Though they claim natural caverns when they can, they make do with areas of dense, twisted vegetation within a swamp. Black dragon treasure hoards primarily consist of gems and expensive glass work, as valuables of softer substance can’t survive the dragon’s acidic presence.","Dragon, Black",11
Adult Blue Dragon,"Blue dragons are the sleek and poised cosmopolitans of the chromatic dragons. Their brand of evil is organized, manipulative, and regal. Blue dragons often lair near or within cities and set out to bend the population to their will and gather hordes of servants. These dragons love spinning webs of conspiracy. A blue dragon’s lackeys typically don’t even realize that they serve a dragon, but instead think the protection money, tariffs, or taxes they are amassing is treasure for a cruel but legitimate master. In some ways, blue dragons even see their servants as a living hoard and value them like treasure. These dragons have been known to use these tactics even with their own chromatic cousins. Not all blue dragons work clandestinely. Some lord over desert tribes and hill people like vengeful gods, demanding both tribute and worship. No matter how blue dragons manage their underlings, their bearing is regal and their lairs palatial; they’re universally intolerant of insubordination, incompetence, and embezzlement, and punish perpetrators with murderous efficiency. Blue dragons are also known for their use and mastery of illusion magic. They make use of illusions to augment their manipulations and bewilder their foes in battle. Blue dragons also have some control over water, but use this ability to destroy water, something quite dangerous for those who encounter them in their desert lairs. The ideal lair for a blue dragon contains multiple passages, rooms, and secret chambers. As social creatures, blue dragons prefer to host guests in comfort—but their dwellings should not be so public that just anyone can come calling. A force of guards keeps out intruders, and clever illusions conceal the edifice from prying eyes. Rather than a pile of coins or gems, a blue dragon’s true hoard is the rich furnishings in its citadel— expensive art, ornate furniture, and architectural marvels.","Dragon, Blue",13
Adult Brass Dragon,"Brass dragons are whimsical tricksters who delight in humor and play. They particularly enjoy conversations with humans and other civilized humanoids, delighting in the naive customs of these diminutive races without showing them haughtiness or scorn. While they may seem merely curious, brass dragons engage in this sort of conversation with the goal of keeping up to date on regional politics so they can anticipate future conflicts. Along the way, they create extensive information networks that begin with their own allies but stretch across all levels of humanoid society—networks which the brass dragon then uses to subtly assist settlements near their lair. Unlike the schemes and manipulations of blue dragons, brass dragons use their informant networks to establish justice and equality. These carefree dragons value independence and feel that all creatures deserve to live as they please, provided they don’t harm others. They are emotional creatures and tend to have short attention spans, sometimes falling victim to depression in their twilight years. To combat this, some brass dragons keep pets and houseplants that they can care for. Though they may seem childlike in their curiosity concerning mortal affairs, a brass dragon’s prowess in battle is no laughing matter. A brass dragon whose territory or allies are threatened is a terrifying foe indeed, quick to shed their innocent guise and unleash their terrifying might upon evildoers. Most brass dragons live in desert climates, and while they keep their lairs hidden, they often build near humanoid settlements.","Dragon, Brass",11
Adult Brine Dragon,"Brine dragons are usually blue-green in color, with shiny scales, crests that help them glide through the water, and sweeping neck frills. They care little for either good or evil. As they are both opinionated and willing to impose their sense of order on others, many brine dragons eventually seek to rule over a meticulously crafted community. These communities are orderly and well-planned, with rigid standards of courtesy and unchanging laws set down by the dragon themself. A settlement seeded by a brine dragon can be made of members of almost any ancestry, but the most common inhabitants are humans, merfolk, tengus, or sahuagin.Depending on the dragon's personality, their community members might view their brine dragon ruler as anything from a benevolent force of order to a fearful tyrant. Regardless, the typical brine dragon has little patience for kindness or philanthropy, and the strength and health of their settlement as a whole are of greater concern than individuals' well-being. A notable exception to this dispassion rises when an outside force encroaches on their lands. In these cases, the brine dragon is quick to step in and aid in the defense of their community.Although brine dragons enjoy cultivating settlements, they rarely make their lairs within the city limits, instead preferring to dwell in sea caves or cliffside grottoes overlooking the coastline. Here they can retreat for privacy as needed, or can accumulate and display their gathered wealth in a place where they feel safe spreading out their treasures. Brine dragon hoards often consist of a mix of offerings and taxes paid by those they rule over and strange discoveries salvaged from sunken ships.","Dragon, Brine",12
Adult Bronze Dragon,"Bronze dragons are among the most common of metallic dragons and the most likely to ally with mortals on worthy quests. However, they are naturally scholarly creatures who would rather remain in their lairs studying esoteric lore than go off on a wild adventure. These aloof and stoic dragons also act as preservationists, guarding storehouses of ancient lore from destruction or perversion. Bronze dragons are principled and protective, but while their silver cousins are quick to crusade for justice, bronze dragons prefer to find an important location worthy of their protection and guard it against any attack or unwelcome intrusion. Bronze dragons’ mastery over water and affinity for electricity means they are a boon to sailors caught in thunderstorms. A bronze dragon’s enemies quickly discover neither cloudy sky nor turbulent sea provides shelter from their wrath. Bronze dragons lair along shorelines, often in partially submerged sea caves. While all dragons keep hoards of treasure, the hoard of a bronze dragon more resembles a vast library—with the shelves kept carefully above the waterline, of course. In addition to their collections of esoteric lore, bronze dragons keep treasures associated with the sea, such as beautiful scrimshaw, flawless pearls, and equipment inlaid with mother-of-pearl and abalone shell.","Dragon, Bronze",13
Adult Cloud Dragon,"At heart, cloud dragons are wanderers, explorers, and travelers who enjoy nothing more than seeing new lands and meeting unusual creatures. Cloud dragons range in color from light blue to a pale, milky white and have thick, curling horns and rather short snouts. They keep lairs among the extreme altitudes of the highest mountain peaks but are away on their many journeys as often as they're at home. Cloud dragons spend long hours surveying the lands they fly over from great heights, but they are creatures of whim, making it hard to predict what will pique their curiosity and bring them winging down to converse or investigate something on the ground. Cloud dragons seldom perform acts of outright malice, but they are not often charitable either. A cloud dragon is as likely to simply pluck something they desire off the ground and fly away with it as they are to bargain fairly.A cloud dragon's ever-changing interests never seem to stray toward the complicated schemes and long-term plans of other dragons. These rovers are creatures of the moment, and although they are as mentally gifted as other true dragons, their interests remain in the here and now. Yet the cloud dragon's penchant for living in the moment is not a personality flaw—they're more than capable of anticipating long-term results of their actions and won't make foolish choices simply to pursue a current interest. At the same time, cloud dragons have little interest in worrying about the future and are as confident in their ability to handle tomorrow's problems as they are today's.Cloud dragon hoards tend to be well-guarded or well-hidden, as a natural result of their roving habits often taking them away from their lairs for extended periods. Their treasuries include a wide variety of items—they are driven to gather a broad range of prizes rather than collecting one type of item intensively. To a cloud dragon, a diversified hoard is a perfect hoard.","Dragon, Cloud",14
Adult Copper Dragon,"Capricious and always eager to share a good laugh, copper dragons are among the wiliest of the metallic dragons, but this by no means interferes with their mission to spread freedom in oppressive lands. Copper dragons are hedonists who are quick to indulge in simple pleasures, but they’re also sympathetic to other creatures, slow to pass judgment, and careful to always examine a situation from as many perspectives as possible. This philosophy has its drawbacks, however, as copper dragons are susceptible to negative influences and prone to forgiving the less serious evil acts performed by their chromatic cousins and other cruel creatures. Copper dragons also have a difficult time keeping their temper in check once they are roused to anger. Copper dragons tend to lair in warm or temperate hills, but due to their nature, they move their lairs every few years. They sometimes live among other people, especially any dwarves who reside nearby. Some copper dragons even worship gods typically worshipped only by humanoids. Among these dragons, worship of Cayden Cailean is most popular, as they see his love of freedom and penchant for alcohol aligning with the typical copper dragon mindset. A copper dragon’s combat tactics are as unorthodox as its sense of humor, as it is more likely to use mockery and tricks than outright strength to win its battles. As a copper dragon ages, it perfects jokes capable of rendering its foes helpless with laughter.","Dragon, Copper",12
Adult Crystal Dragon,"Good-natured but vain, crystal dragons are beautiful creatures with brilliant hides made of multicolored crystal and gemstone. Their beauty is a source of great pride but is also something of a weakness, as crystal dragons are easily angered by insults about their appearance. Despite their relatively benign natures when compared to other true dragons, crystal dragons can be short tempered and prone to finding insults where none were intended. Although their opinions are changeable, crystal dragons prefer orderly environments and are not fond of sudden interruptions or distractions.Crystal dragons build their lairs in underground grottoes, where they cultivate environments of great beauty. Their exacting standards and vivid imaginations mean that they are always working to improve the appearance or layout of some part of their lair. These lairs are unique to each individual crystal dragon, but there are always plenty of reflective surfaces that allow the dragon to observe their own appearance. These range from crystals to reflecting pools to finely crafted mirrors, which are arranged throughout the lair in a pleasing array. Gifts of well-crafted or magical mirrors are an excellent way to curry favor with a crystal dragon.Although crystal dragons are easily distracted by their sparkling collections or their vanity, they remain good-hearted creatures at the core and make friends quickly. While a crystal dragon tends to find evil creatures uncouth and unpleasant, any other nearby denizen or inhabitant of their home could become fast friends or beloved pets, depending upon the creature's capacity for conversation (and for providing the frequent praise and compliments that crystal dragons hunger for).","Dragon, Crystal",11
Adult Forest Dragon,"Forest dragons oversee the endless growth of nature, protect it from plunder, and reclaim ruins for the wilderness. Some say these dragons jealously hoard nature's bounty for themselves while seeing everyone else who tries to benefit from nature as thieves and poachers. They loathe the progress of technology and civilization, preferring the company of monsters and animals. Forest dragons are their forests in a literal sense. Over time, their hair becomes mossy, their hide toughens like bark, and small insects or animals live within them. ","Dragon, Forest",14
Adult Gold Dragon,"Gold dragons are the epitome of metallic dragonkind, unrivaled in their strength as well as their wisdom. They command the unwavering reverence of all other metallic dragons, who view gold dragons as their leaders and counselors. Golds rival the raw power of even red dragons, much to the chagrin of their chromatic cousins, and the two races are often regarded as bitter rivals. But despite their incredible power, gold dragons are fond of discourse and prefer to talk through solutions to problems rather than rely upon brute strength. Long-lived as they are, they necessarily take a wide view of all situations and never act without considering all possible options and outcomes. Because of this, gold dragons willingly converse with any creature that seeks them out, even evil chromatic dragons. Mortals might find this behavior strange, considering the longstanding war between chromatic and metallic dragons, but dragons know all too well that desperate situations sometimes call for drastic alliances. And although gold dragons might consider brief truces with their chromatic brethren in the case of world-ending threats, they also know when such alliances have run their course. When another metallic dragon faces a quandary or a foe beyond its own ability to overcome, its best option is often to seek the counsel of the eternally wise and gloriously righteous gold dragons. Locating these legendary beings is no easy task, however, for gold dragons are notoriously reclusive. Their intellect and wisdom is such that they prefer to ponder the great questions of life in seclusion, where they strive to formulate solutions to the world's most pressing problems. As a result, gold dragons are sometimes absent when metallic dragons gather together, or are missing from tribunals where their counsel would be beneficial. Impatient dragons sometimes begrudge gold dragons for this apparent unreliability, but such aspersions are usually a result of jealousy rather than any true criticism; in their hearts, other dragons know that few gold dragons purposefully exclude themselves from truly important matters. A gold dragon's incredible foresight and unparalleled enlightenment means they are unlikely to interfere in the business of individual mortals, though the rare person who captures the attention of a gold dragon is fortunate indeed, for there are few beings in the cosmos who can offer such prudent and considerate advice. Rulers and individuals in stations of high power have an easier time of garnering the aid of a gold dragon; entire wars have been avoided thanks to a gold dragon's last-minute intermediation. Gold dragons are often found in warm grasslands and savannas, lands where they can enjoy long, meditative flights without attracting the attention of potential enemies. They tend to sleep either out in the open in a barren, remote place, or within a heavily secreted or fortified lair, such as a forgotten sink hole or in the labyrinthine caverns of a terrestrial chasm. Gold dragons may enlist trusted servants and allies to guard their lairs, though many live truly solitary lives, preferring to protect their hoards with nonlethal traps and magical wards.","Dragon, Gold",15
Adult Green Dragon,"Green dragons are the most contemplative of the chromatic dragons as well as the most approachable. The key to understanding green dragons is to understand their obsession with knowledge and self-discipline. Any careful approach that takes advantage of a green dragon’s fixations may end in a diplomatic outcome, but any misstep or slight can provoke a savage attack. Like most chromatic dragons, green dragons do not suffer fools—and the threshold for what they consider foolish is very low. Though more open than their chromatic cousins to dealing with other creatures and dragons, green dragons prefer an isolated and quiet life. They tend to lair in the most forbidding parts of a forest, surrounded by tangled thickets, or else at the heart of some dismal gulch. If the terrain is suitable, some green dragons make their home in natural caves, which they expand to suit their needs. Green dragons’ pride leads them to see to the preservation of their forest homes. They feel that a verdant and lush forest is something that they alone have cultivated. This leads some green dragons to follow the path of druidism, though most prefer to study the arcane arts and occult lore. Most of them delve deeply into one particular field of study, and correspond with other scholars in the field by adopting a pen name that hides their true nature. Regardless of their chosen focus, green dragons seek to improve themselves, and their desire for knowledge makes them more likely to deal diplomatically with other creatures in order to obtain new information. Their hoards are typically well kept, organized, and filled with tomes of lore and scrolls of magic along with antiquities they collect for their own inscrutable reasons. Many of these treasures come from across the globe, and many an adventurer has survived an encounter with a green dragon by stroking its ego and plying it with rare artifacts or lost lore from ancient cultures.","Dragon, Green",12
Adult Magma Dragon,"Magma dragons have a reputation among other dragons for being unpredictable and brash. Their temperament and tendency for violent outbursts ensure that the typical magma dragon lives a solitary life, with hatchlings often bickering or fighting to establish dominance among themselves before they leave the nest. A magma dragon always has a reason for their outbursts and can always justify their sudden turns in mood, yet they rarely feel the need to do so.Magma dragons build lairs within volcanically active mountains or deep underground amid vast lakes of bubbling magma. As with all true dragons, magma dragons keep hoards of treasure, but the nature of their searing lairs limits the type of valuables they collect to metals, gems, and items capable of resisting the heat of a volcano's core.","Dragon, Magma",13
Adult Red Dragon,"The largest and most powerful of the chromatic dragons, red dragons are a menace to civilizations everywhere, and their strength is rivaled only by their arrogance. Red dragons see themselves as regents and overlords of all dragonkind. With their crowns of crimson spikes and their command of blistering frame, this is no haughty boast in their eyes—only unquestioned fact. Red dragons don’t deign to speak with lesser creatures; they simply dominate and burn, enslaving weaker creatures to act as servants and to look after their lairs while the dragons slumber away. They take pleasure in dominating these creatures, and they demand tribute from their supplicants. Those who anger or disappoint end up eaten or reduced to ash. They command their enslaved minions to constantly build onto their lairs, carving out new tunnels and designing cunning traps that ensure the dragon’s security. Driven by their arrogance, red dragons are the most likely of the chromatic dragons to ravage settlements. They want the world to see them in their rightful place as powerful tyrants, and they delight in threatening all other creatures. They have no qualms about bullying, manipulating, or killing to complete their goals—or simply intimidating others through a public display of brutality and dominance. As legendary as the brutishness of red dragons is the magnificence of their hoards of gold. Their lairs are often situated in dangerous places, with volcanoes being a favorite spot, as they find them foreboding and the constant warmth is comfortable. No matter the locale, red dragons sleep on a litter of coins and other treasures, which they zealously guard. Sometimes, the dragon’s internal heat causes these precious metals to fuse together.","Dragon, Red",14
Adult Sea Dragon,"Sea dragons' affinity with water grants them mastery over rain, storms, and floods. Those whose livelihoods are at the mercy of the weather and waves frequently venerate these great aquatic creatures. Most sea dragons respond kindly to requests, but, like the sea, they can be unpredictable and fickle. Sea dragons have disk-shaped scales like fish and webbed claws as well as large back and tail fins to aid in swimming. They appear in vivid and vibrant colors, like aquatic wildlife. Underwater flora and fauna grow and thrive upon older sea dragons, and ancient sea dragons often have a head of coral around their antlers, giving them the image of being crowned royalty.","Dragon, Sea",12
Adult Silver Dragon,"Silver dragons are among the most chivalrous of all dragonkind; they wield frost and cold as weapons, can walk on clouds, and dwell high upon snowy mountain peaks or deep in steep, misty valleys. Although they typically make their lairs among the highlands, the pursuit of justice leads silver dragons to travel far and wide—often into the very heart of realms overrun by evil. These exemplars of righteousness are ceaseless in their determination to help the weak, spread honor, and stamp out evil. Silver dragons are sleek and sinuous. Their hides resemble nothing so much as a suit of gleaming armor, lending further credence to the popular myth that silver dragons are the paladins of dragonkind. The zeal with which they seek out, confront, and defeat evil is unsurpassed even among their metallic cousins, and they adhere to strict codes of honor usually passed down from parent to hatchling. On occasion, they instead learn these codes from trusted mentors, usually other silver dragons or gold dragons. As they age, they become even more dedicated to their codes, often adding new and even more restrictive clauses to the systems that guide their behavior. Silver dragons are incredibly altruistic and regularly consort with the citizens of goodly societies, of which they consider themselves protectors and guides. In addition to responding to evil threats, silver dragons work to prevent evil from taking root in the first place, and they ensure mortals under their care are well fed, educated, and treated with dignity. Although silver dragons can seem overzealous or even eager to join the fight against evil, they know that the best way to rid the world of corruption is to stamp out strife and disillusionment at their source, not to passively sit back and watch it grow into an unsolvable problem. Silver dragons can be vindictive, but they can also be forgiving; for evildoers who seek to atone for their sins and turn over a new leaf, the support of a silver dragon is both unwavering and invaluable. Many silver dragons are also drawn to religious endeavors, venerating deities such as Iomedae, Sarenrae, and other deities concerned with justice, virtue, and redemption.","Dragon, Silver",14
Adult Sky Dragon,"Sky dragons live above the clouds near the summits of mountains. They maintain a strong religious tradition, a unique practice among imperial dragons that sets them apart as much as their wings do. Desperate souls risk steep cliffs and loose snow to seek these dragons' counsel, and most sky dragons gladly help those who make the journey, but they expel any express hostilities or badger without hesitation. The sky dragon's wings aren't true wings, but long fins fused to their forearms; their scales also form only very slowly. Young dragons coil tightly in their lairs as they absorb minerals that color and harden their scales. Even adults often wrap around pillars out of habit.","Dragon, Sky",13
Adult Sovereign Dragon,"The most well-known of imperial dragons due to their deep involvement with mortals, the sovereign dragons' name comes from their mandate of selecting rulers—but at some point, the dragons themselves joined the list of worthy candidates. Other imperial dragons suspect the sovereign dragons offered their connection to the elemental cycle to attain forbidden magic, evidenced by their lack of any vulnerability to wood or ability to feed on fire, despite being creatures of the earth. Most hesitate to question the sovereigns' authority. While some appreciate their impartial nature, others fault this adherence to neutrality. Regardless, the sovereign dragons' charm and centuries of experience in subtle manipulation have made them exceptional negotiators. Almost all sovereign dragons appear gold in color. Their hair ranges from common colors found among humans to bright reds, greens, or blues. They're the only dragons with five digits per claw, a mark of special importance. Other imperial dragons dismiss this claim to status and instead tease the sovereign dragons over their need to wear armor, even while in their draconic forms.","Dragon, Sovereign",15
Adult Umbral Dragon,"While the other primal dragons hail from the Elemental Planes, the cruel and unceasingly malicious umbral dragons originate in the depths of the Shadow Plane. Their sleek black scales and serpentine grace allow them to strike from hiding, and they are known for playing with their prey before finally finishing it. These creatures of shadowy energy and unwholesome appetites prefer the necrotic flesh of undead creatures to any other meal. This strange hunger can be of accidental benefit to nearby humanoid societies, but ultimately they hunt and kill undead creatures for the taste, rather than out of any desire to protect others from the undead. The benefit is always short-lived, however. When umbral dragons exhaust their preferred prey, they turn on whatever living creatures happen to be nearby. Umbral dragons sometimes go to great lengths to obtain their favorite meals, even creating undead creatures that they then feast upon.For all their power, umbral dragons are uninterested in fair battles. When faced with foes that pose any kind of actual danger to them, umbral dragons flee into the shadows and seek to strike back through pawns or minions rather than risk their own lives. Their treasure hoards are varied and diverse, often augmented by loot stolen from crypts the dragons have turned into feeding grounds. They have a strong respect for and interest in traditions and heirlooms, and they often seek to augment their hoards with items of great value that have been handed down through the generations of those whose corpses and ghosts they've fed upon.","Dragon, Umbral",15
Adult Underworld Dragon,"Underworld dragons embody the pressure between tectonic plates, the heat behind geysers, and flash fires that ignite when the conditions are just right. Natural alchemists, they innately understand reagents and catalysts. While some research the effects of magic on material reactions, the majority of underworld dragons concentrate on building their hoards. They scour the world for carved gemstones and artifacts of precious minerals, both of which they see as distilled essence of earth's bounty. Underworld dragons appear angular and sharp; their scales glow as if superheated from within, and their hair flickers like tongues of flames. An intense fire glows behind their gazes, suggesting they could ignite items with a mere thought, and their breath ripples the air as a testament to the heat contained within their bodies.","Dragon, Underworld",11
Adult White Dragon,"The most feral and least intelligent of all the chromatic dragons, white dragons are brutish, predatory, and chiefly motivated by self-preservation. Nearly all other dragons look down on white dragons as hopelessly hotheaded and dull, though this does not make them any less dangerous—in fact, it may mean the opposite. It’s nearly impossible to treat with white dragons, not because they lack the capacity to do so, but because they just don’t care to. They are as difficult to deal with as they are quick to anger, and they become incensed at almost anything. When a white dragon does speak, it spews threats, inane jokes, and incoherent babbling as a prelude to attacking—and when the attack comes, it’s bloody and relentless. Thankfully, white dragons prefer very cold, remote locations that are far from people. Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds. They fly out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass near the dragon’s territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference for items with high utility—such as tools, trade goods, and fine food—over coins or jewels. The ability to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly to their specifications, and they take great pride in how they’ve decorated their homes over the years.","Dragon, White",10
Advisor,"Trusted counselors of the court, advisors whisper words of guidance in the ears of those in power. Many nobles lean so heavily on their counsel that they make few decisions without them and insist on their attendance at all meetings and public events. Advisors are often master manipulators, and their guidance can shape a barony or even a kingdom—for good or ill.",Courtiers,5
Aeolaeka (Stone Azata),"Aeolaekas, also known as stone azatas, embody the slow but inevitable chaos of rock itself. Stone is often thought to be steadfast and unchanging, but, when viewed on a grander scale over vast periods of time, stone can transform into things as diverse as intricate crystals and fine powder. To the aeolaeka, anything that could become either sand or diamond is the very incarnation of the chaos of reality—just on a slower scale. As a result of their stone affinity, aeolaekas are less capricious than other azatas, and some have willingly forged lasting accords or agreements with mortals. Stone-skinned aeolaekas are sometimes mistaken for statues and use this fact to hide in plain sight when they don't want their presence known.",Azata,12

Aghash,"Walking embodiments of curses, misfortune, and the evil eye, aghashes wander the deserts of the Material Plane, searching out the arrogant, charming, and persuasive to humiliate and undermine. Aghashes are often mistaken for some strange form of hag, and like those creatures, they're masters at curses.",Div,4

Agradaemon,"Equal parts lion, spider, and demagogue, agradaemons are born from the forge-flames of Szuriel, Horseman of War. Although they're unwilling to work alongside each other for long, agradaemons frequently establish themselves as leaders of cults whose goal is to burn civilization to the ground. To these scheming monsters of flame and fear, torching a city is a mere diversion; incinerating a nation's entire agricultural system to turn its citizens into starving marauders before setting their forests and plains ablaze is truly satisfying.",Daemon,19
Ahuizotl,"The ahuizotl is a vicious, semi-aquatic predator that resembles a hideous cross between a badger and an otter, with disturbingly web-fingered paws supplemented by a fifth hand at the end of a long, serpentine tail. A clever and stealthy hunter, the ahuizotl lures unwary prey to their doom by mimicking the cries of people in distress. The ahuizotl's macabre habit of feeding on a victim's eyes, fingernails, and teeth leaves the corpses of its kills uniquely mutilated. Some say the creatures consider these body parts delicacies, while others insist ahuizotls collect them as tribute to a powerful but unknown entity. The fact that an ahuizotl does not eat the actual flesh of its victims, instead depositing their savaged and waterlogged corpses in locations where the remains are sure to be found by friends or family, points to a third and perhaps more likely possibility—the ahuizotl simply enjoys using its violent dietary quirks to spread fear and despair. An ahuizotl walks on all fours, but its hands are capable of manipulating simple tools and other objects. Ahuizotls have roughly mustelid features and an extra membrane covering their eyes, giving their eyes a dull color suggestive of cataracts and somewhat blunting the creature's vision. Yet despite their bestial appearance, ahuizotls are nearly as intelligent as the average human, and wiser than most. Although they don't form societies of their own, they have been known to ally with violent cults or conclaves of monsters, and even to found small shrines and temples to sinister deities. The cult of Charon, the horseman of Death, is particularly popular among certain ahuizotls, who look forward to an afterlife spent wallowing in the waters of the River Styx.",,6
Air Mephit,Air mephits are capricious and flighty relative to their kin; they are as likely to fly blindly into battle as they are to whine in terror at a loud noise.

Aiudara Wraith,"Dahak’s influence in Alseta’s Landing created a soul-draining effect that slays unprotected creatures within, transforming them into ghostly creatures known as aiudara wraiths, but these rare undead can rise within modern aiudara portals as well. Each time an individual travels through an aiudara, there’s a chance their passage could leave a faint imprint of their subconscious in the network. Normally this imprint simply fades away, but when an aiudara is damaged or the individual is suffering from necromantic contagions, these imprints can accumulate and, in time, coalesce on the Astral Plane or within Alseta’s Landing as a full-fledged aiudara wraith. The wraith is forced to live with an incomplete sense of self, always seeking its own memories and swiftly growing violent and vengeful as its quest to reclaim these ephemeral notions constantly meets with failure.",Wraith,18
Akata,"An akata is a hairless, blue-skinned quadruped with fearsome jaws, glowing eyes, a pair of thin tails, and a mane of writhing tentacles. It is a strangely silent beast, as it lacks the lungs and vocal chords necessary to vocalize. It also lacks ears, but it has heightened visual and olfactory senses.When food is scarce, an akata secretes a resin from its pores that forms into a sturdy cocoon of pale green crystal—the skymetal noqual. An akata can hibernate in this cocoon without needing to eat or drink for centuries, though it retains a rudimentary sense of its surroundings and can break out in only a few minutes' time. These cocoons allow the creatures to travel through the void of space, seeking new worlds where they can infect suitable humanoid hosts with their larval young. Once a victim succumbs to this infection, the offspring fight among themselves until one proves the strongest. The surviving akata then animates the corpse—now a void zombie—which shambles about of its own accord.",,1
Akizendri,"Akizendris gnaw at sources of knowledge and lore, gleefully corrupting and altering them to vex scholars and sages across the planes with contradictions and untruths. These proteans appear as cackling, serpentine creatures with elongated crocodilian faces, luminous eyes, and arms that vanish at the elbows into swirling clouds of runes before reforming into solid talons. Akizendris amuse themselves by rearranging or deleting texts, placing insulting acrostics in poetic verses, and penning crude insults upon title pages. Libraries in such places as Heaven, Axis, and Hell are especially keen to avoid such contamination, knowing that their records are choice targets for every akizendri in existence.",Protean,3

Alchemical Golem,"This golem is a walking alchemical nightmare capable of inflicting all manner of painful wounds. Its ability to follow orders is granted by the otherwise mindless humanoid brain that floats in its dome-like head. In exceptionally rare cases, the brain used in its creation might retain fragments of memories or even actual intellect, resulting in an alchemical golem with a personality and agenda of its own.",Golem,9
Alghollthu Master,"Aboleths form the core of alghollthu society, and while they are the “common folk” of their own societies, they see themselves as masters of all others. Unlike their leaders, who mask their actions using magical disguises, aboleths revel in their monstrous forms, appearing as primeval fish with tentacles. Masters of psychic manipulation, they are a species so ancient that they were present in the world when it was young, before the gods had turned their attention to the planet. They see all other life as something they have the right to control, so the idea that potential slaves might have faith in a higher power other than themselves enrages aboleths.",Alghollthu,7
Aluum Enforcer,"The most common aluum is powered by the bound soul of a loyal city servant, but its creation is among the Pactmasters’ most guarded secrets. There are dozens of dormant aluums spread throughout Katapesh, and only someone wearing an aluum charm can activate and command one of these 14-foot-tall soldiers. The Pactmasters entrust few beyond the Zephyr Guard to carry these charms, and stealing such a charm is one of the most severe crimes in the city.",Aluum,10
Amalgamite,"Teleportation magic can prove a difficult undertaking, even for experienced spellcasters. It requires precise calculation and timing, knowledge of the intended destination, and meticulous control over surging conjuration magics. A mistake in even the most minute element of such a spell can lead to disastrous results for those involved. When a particularly powerful spellcaster makes an error of this kind, either through arrogance or simple misjudgment, they might transform into an amalgamite. A mass of flesh and misaligned limbs, an amalgamite is the warped body of a former spellcaster, sometimes joined with another version of itself to incorporate additional limbs or other irregularities. They're still alive, but they have become aberrants mentally and physically, with only the vaguest memories of their previous existence, which makes them a dangerous and bewildering foe. Their weird, warped anatomy constantly shifts and regrows, allowing the creatures to shrug off physical blows save those that pierce through its flesh and into its core being. The magical residue of an amalgamite's creation radiates from it, seeping into and destabilizing any living beings that get too close. Infected creatures then further spread the amalgamite's aura among larger groups of allies and foes alike. The amalgamite uses this power to manipulate and confuse their enemies, whom they can teleport into traps, force into confrontations with other enemies, or draw close into striking range with their own odd appendages.",,13
Amelekana,"Amelekanas are amphibious ambush predators native to rivers and lakes across Castrovel. An amelekana looks similar to a giant snail, with an opalescent spiraling shell and eyeless face sporting a crown of six antennae, but that's where the resemblance ends. Instead of one giant foot, the amelekana has fleshy tubes standing upright through holes in its shell and a host of tiny armored legs, like those of a crab. Yet perhaps the most unusual feature of the amelekana is that it's actually a symbiotic community of two separate organisms, neither of which can live without the other. Like many creatures on Castrovel, amelekanas have some basic psychic ability—in their case, a sense for nearby living creatures. A hunting amelekana submerges itself to obscure its location. When prey draws near, the amelekana rises from the water and releases compressed gasses to launch its symbiotes—blobby amoebas the size of a bread loaf—at their victims. These amoebas act as external digesters for the stomachless amelekana, using their acidic coating to dissolve prey and absorb nutrition. Once its amoebas have had their fill, the amelekana slurps them back up, providing the amoeba colony with a safe haven inside its body in exchange for a portion of the processed nutrients. A typical amelekana is 9 feet long and weighs up to 2,000 pounds.",,4
Ammut,"These chimeric, desert-dwelling fiends have massive bodies that are part hippopotamus, part large cat, and part crocodile. Though they devour souls for sustenance, ammuts are infamously picky eaters; most will only eat experienced adventurers or, for a special treat, particularly evil creatures, passing over common folk or those whose mettle has never been tested. Only a few ammuts are known to exist, and most dwell in Osirion. However, recent expeditions into Orv's Vault of the Black Desert have uncovered the existence of ammuts in this region, as well.",,18
Amoeba Swarm,"An amoeba swarm consists of thousands of individual single-celled organisms held together by acrid-smelling slime. As ravenous as they are mindless, amoeba swarms use no tactics.",Ooze,1
Amphisbaena,"An amphisbaena is an exceedingly aggressive, venomous viper of remarkable size that bears two heads—one on each end of its body. It moves in a manner similar to that of the more common sidewinder snake, throwing its body forward in a loop and anchoring itself by keeping one head or the other on the ground at all times. Amphisbaenas' typical prey includes rabbits, foxes, various birds, small deer, and even humanoids if presented the opportunity. Fiercely territorial by nature, they attack just about anything that gets near their lairs, regardless of the intruder's size. Many a child has been warned about going too far into the woods alone, lest they wander too close to an amphisbaena den and become the creature's next meal. The venom of an amphisbaena is incredibly potent, able to take down a stout dwarf within minutes if left untreated. However, it also has uses in a variety of healing remedies, which makes it a valuable commodity if collected. For example, a pregnant person might be advised to drink the venom in small, dilute doses to help safeguard the pregnancy. Mixing small amounts of the venom with various herbs and oil creates a poultice which dulls aches and pains. As a result, the image of an amphisbaena appears in many contexts associated with healing and alchemical subjects, such as labels for tinctures, annotations in herbalists' records, and illustrations in textbooks of medicine. The first amphisbaena is said to have formed from the blood that fell as a medusa's head was severed. This story's origin most likely stems from the fact that amphisbaenas are oddly immune to petrification, which in turn leads to them sometimes being kept as pets by a medusa. A medusa who keeps an amphisbaena as a pet might regard the viper as their most treasured companion or perhaps even as their own child. Despite these fabled supernatural origins and the occasional special treatment they receive, however, amphisbaenas are entirely mundane animals with only rudimentary intelligence and no innate magical abilities whatsoever.",,4

Ancient Black Dragon,"Murderous tyrants of marshes, swamps, bogs, and fens, black dragons terrorize their domains with intense fervor. Gleefully sadistic, they rule their fetid principalities from a deep cave or otherwise isolated part of the swamp with a mix of lightning-quick raids and subterfuge. Their hatred for other creatures is as acidic as their breath weapons, and they rarely tolerate even other dragons of their kind—except perhaps to mate or temporarily collaborate to take down a mutual enemy. Black dragons are amphibious—although they breathe air, their gills also allow them to breathe water. Their frills and fins make them accomplished swimmers, well suited to their wetland environments and submerged lairs. They’re immune to the fetid water that comes as a result of their magical ability to corrupt water. Black dragon lairs are as foul as their souls. The floors are littered with rotting meat, and plundered treasures line the muck and slime of their dank caves amid twisted roots and creepers. Such places are often crawling with pests, snakes, and slimes. Though they claim natural caverns when they can, they make do with areas of dense, twisted vegetation within a swamp. Black dragon treasure hoards primarily consist of gems and expensive glass work, as valuables of softer substance can’t survive the dragon’s acidic presence.","Dragon, Black",16
Ancient Blue Dragon,"Blue dragons are the sleek and poised cosmopolitans of the chromatic dragons. Their brand of evil is organized, manipulative, and regal. Blue dragons often lair near or within cities and set out to bend the population to their will and gather hordes of servants. These dragons love spinning webs of conspiracy. A blue dragon’s lackeys typically don’t even realize that they serve a dragon, but instead think the protection money, tariffs, or taxes they are amassing is treasure for a cruel but legitimate master. In some ways, blue dragons even see their servants as a living hoard and value them like treasure. These dragons have been known to use these tactics even with their own chromatic cousins. Not all blue dragons work clandestinely. Some lord over desert tribes and hill people like vengeful gods, demanding both tribute and worship. No matter how blue dragons manage their underlings, their bearing is regal and their lairs palatial; they’re universally intolerant of insubordination, incompetence, and embezzlement, and punish perpetrators with murderous efficiency. Blue dragons are also known for their use and mastery of illusion magic. They make use of illusions to augment their manipulations and bewilder their foes in battle. Blue dragons also have some control over water, but use this ability to destroy water, something quite dangerous for those who encounter them in their desert lairs. The ideal lair for a blue dragon contains multiple passages, rooms, and secret chambers. As social creatures, blue dragons prefer to host guests in comfort—but their dwellings should not be so public that just anyone can come calling. A force of guards keeps out intruders, and clever illusions conceal the edifice from prying eyes. Rather than a pile of coins or gems, a blue dragon’s true hoard is the rich furnishings in its citadel— expensive art, ornate furniture, and architectural marvels.","Dragon, Blue",18
Ancient Brass Dragon,"Brass dragons are whimsical tricksters who delight in humor and play. They particularly enjoy conversations with humans and other civilized humanoids, delighting in the naive customs of these diminutive races without showing them haughtiness or scorn. While they may seem merely curious, brass dragons engage in this sort of conversation with the goal of keeping up to date on regional politics so they can anticipate future conflicts. Along the way, they create extensive information networks that begin with their own allies but stretch across all levels of humanoid society—networks which the brass dragon then uses to subtly assist settlements near their lair. Unlike the schemes and manipulations of blue dragons, brass dragons use their informant networks to establish justice and equality. These carefree dragons value independence and feel that all creatures deserve to live as they please, provided they don’t harm others. They are emotional creatures and tend to have short attention spans, sometimes falling victim to depression in their twilight years. To combat this, some brass dragons keep pets and houseplants that they can care for. Though they may seem childlike in their curiosity concerning mortal affairs, a brass dragon’s prowess in battle is no laughing matter. A brass dragon whose territory or allies are threatened is a terrifying foe indeed, quick to shed their innocent guise and unleash their terrifying might upon evildoers. Most brass dragons live in desert climates, and while they keep their lairs hidden, they often build near humanoid settlements.","Dragon, Brass",16
Ancient Brine Dragon,"Brine dragons are usually blue-green in color, with shiny scales, crests that help them glide through the water, and sweeping neck frills. They care little for either good or evil. As they are both opinionated and willing to impose their sense of order on others, many brine dragons eventually seek to rule over a meticulously crafted community. These communities are orderly and well-planned, with rigid standards of courtesy and unchanging laws set down by the dragon themself. A settlement seeded by a brine dragon can be made of members of almost any ancestry, but the most common inhabitants are humans, merfolk, tengus, or sahuagin.Depending on the dragon's personality, their community members might view their brine dragon ruler as anything from a benevolent force of order to a fearful tyrant. Regardless, the typical brine dragon has little patience for kindness or philanthropy, and the strength and health of their settlement as a whole are of greater concern than individuals' well-being. A notable exception to this dispassion rises when an outside force encroaches on their lands. In these cases, the brine dragon is quick to step in and aid in the defense of their community.Although brine dragons enjoy cultivating settlements, they rarely make their lairs within the city limits, instead preferring to dwell in sea caves or cliffside grottoes overlooking the coastline. Here they can retreat for privacy as needed, or can accumulate and display their gathered wealth in a place where they feel safe spreading out their treasures. Brine dragon hoards often consist of a mix of offerings and taxes paid by those they rule over and strange discoveries salvaged from sunken ships.","Dragon, Brine",17
Ancient Bronze Dragon,"Bronze dragons are among the most common of metallic dragons and the most likely to ally with mortals on worthy quests. However, they are naturally scholarly creatures who would rather remain in their lairs studying esoteric lore than go off on a wild adventure. These aloof and stoic dragons also act as preservationists, guarding storehouses of ancient lore from destruction or perversion. Bronze dragons are principled and protective, but while their silver cousins are quick to crusade for justice, bronze dragons prefer to find an important location worthy of their protection and guard it against any attack or unwelcome intrusion. Bronze dragons’ mastery over water and affinity for electricity means they are a boon to sailors caught in thunderstorms. A bronze dragon’s enemies quickly discover neither cloudy sky nor turbulent sea provides shelter from their wrath. Bronze dragons lair along shorelines, often in partially submerged sea caves. While all dragons keep hoards of treasure, the hoard of a bronze dragon more resembles a vast library—with the shelves kept carefully above the waterline, of course. In addition to their collections of esoteric lore, bronze dragons keep treasures associated with the sea, such as beautiful scrimshaw, flawless pearls, and equipment inlaid with mother-of-pearl and abalone shell.","Dragon, Bronze",18
Ancient Cloud Dragon,"At heart, cloud dragons are wanderers, explorers, and travelers who enjoy nothing more than seeing new lands and meeting unusual creatures. Cloud dragons range in color from light blue to a pale, milky white and have thick, curling horns and rather short snouts. They keep lairs among the extreme altitudes of the highest mountain peaks but are away on their many journeys as often as they're at home. Cloud dragons spend long hours surveying the lands they fly over from great heights, but they are creatures of whim, making it hard to predict what will pique their curiosity and bring them winging down to converse or investigate something on the ground. Cloud dragons seldom perform acts of outright malice, but they are not often charitable either. A cloud dragon is as likely to simply pluck something they desire off the ground and fly away with it as they are to bargain fairly.A cloud dragon's ever-changing interests never seem to stray toward the complicated schemes and long-term plans of other dragons. These rovers are creatures of the moment, and although they are as mentally gifted as other true dragons, their interests remain in the here and now. Yet the cloud dragon's penchant for living in the moment is not a personality flaw—they're more than capable of anticipating long-term results of their actions and won't make foolish choices simply to pursue a current interest. At the same time, cloud dragons have little interest in worrying about the future and are as confident in their ability to handle tomorrow's problems as they are today's.Cloud dragon hoards tend to be well-guarded or well-hidden, as a natural result of their roving habits often taking them away from their lairs for extended periods. Their treasuries include a wide variety of items—they are driven to gather a broad range of prizes rather than collecting one type of item intensively. To a cloud dragon, a diversified hoard is a perfect hoard.","Dragon, Cloud",19
Ancient Copper Dragon,"Capricious and always eager to share a good laugh, copper dragons are among the wiliest of the metallic dragons, but this by no means interferes with their mission to spread freedom in oppressive lands. Copper dragons are hedonists who are quick to indulge in simple pleasures, but they’re also sympathetic to other creatures, slow to pass judgment, and careful to always examine a situation from as many perspectives as possible. This philosophy has its drawbacks, however, as copper dragons are susceptible to negative influences and prone to forgiving the less serious evil acts performed by their chromatic cousins and other cruel creatures. Copper dragons also have a difficult time keeping their temper in check once they are roused to anger. Copper dragons tend to lair in warm or temperate hills, but due to their nature, they move their lairs every few years. They sometimes live among other people, especially any dwarves who reside nearby. Some copper dragons even worship gods typically worshipped only by humanoids. Among these dragons, worship of Cayden Cailean is most popular, as they see his love of freedom and penchant for alcohol aligning with the typical copper dragon mindset. A copper dragon’s combat tactics are as unorthodox as its sense of humor, as it is more likely to use mockery and tricks than outright strength to win its battles. As a copper dragon ages, it perfects jokes capable of rendering its foes helpless with laughter.","Dragon, Copper",17
Ancient Crystal Dragon,"Good-natured but vain, crystal dragons are beautiful creatures with brilliant hides made of multicolored crystal and gemstone. Their beauty is a source of great pride but is also something of a weakness, as crystal dragons are easily angered by insults about their appearance. Despite their relatively benign natures when compared to other true dragons, crystal dragons can be short tempered and prone to finding insults where none were intended. Although their opinions are changeable, crystal dragons prefer orderly environments and are not fond of sudden interruptions or distractions.Crystal dragons build their lairs in underground grottoes, where they cultivate environments of great beauty. Their exacting standards and vivid imaginations mean that they are always working to improve the appearance or layout of some part of their lair. These lairs are unique to each individual crystal dragon, but there are always plenty of reflective surfaces that allow the dragon to observe their own appearance. These range from crystals to reflecting pools to finely crafted mirrors, which are arranged throughout the lair in a pleasing array. Gifts of well-crafted or magical mirrors are an excellent way to curry favor with a crystal dragon.Although crystal dragons are easily distracted by their sparkling collections or their vanity, they remain good-hearted creatures at the core and make friends quickly. While a crystal dragon tends to find evil creatures uncouth and unpleasant, any other nearby denizen or inhabitant of their home could become fast friends or beloved pets, depending upon the creature's capacity for conversation (and for providing the frequent praise and compliments that crystal dragons hunger for).","Dragon, Crystal",16
Ancient Forest Dragon,"Forest dragons oversee the endless growth of nature, protect it from plunder, and reclaim ruins for the wilderness. Some say these dragons jealously hoard nature's bounty for themselves while seeing everyone else who tries to benefit from nature as thieves and poachers. They loathe the progress of technology and civilization, preferring the company of monsters and animals. Forest dragons are their forests in a literal sense. Over time, their hair becomes mossy, their hide toughens like bark, and small insects or animals live within them. ","Dragon, Forest",19
Ancient Gold Dragon,"Gold dragons are the epitome of metallic dragonkind, unrivaled in their strength as well as their wisdom. They command the unwavering reverence of all other metallic dragons, who view gold dragons as their leaders and counselors. Golds rival the raw power of even red dragons, much to the chagrin of their chromatic cousins, and the two races are often regarded as bitter rivals. But despite their incredible power, gold dragons are fond of discourse and prefer to talk through solutions to problems rather than rely upon brute strength. Long-lived as they are, they necessarily take a wide view of all situations and never act without considering all possible options and outcomes. Because of this, gold dragons willingly converse with any creature that seeks them out, even evil chromatic dragons. Mortals might find this behavior strange, considering the longstanding war between chromatic and metallic dragons, but dragons know all too well that desperate situations sometimes call for drastic alliances. And although gold dragons might consider brief truces with their chromatic brethren in the case of world-ending threats, they also know when such alliances have run their course. When another metallic dragon faces a quandary or a foe beyond its own ability to overcome, its best option is often to seek the counsel of the eternally wise and gloriously righteous gold dragons. Locating these legendary beings is no easy task, however, for gold dragons are notoriously reclusive. Their intellect and wisdom is such that they prefer to ponder the great questions of life in seclusion, where they strive to formulate solutions to the world's most pressing problems. As a result, gold dragons are sometimes absent when metallic dragons gather together, or are missing from tribunals where their counsel would be beneficial. Impatient dragons sometimes begrudge gold dragons for this apparent unreliability, but such aspersions are usually a result of jealousy rather than any true criticism; in their hearts, other dragons know that few gold dragons purposefully exclude themselves from truly important matters. A gold dragon's incredible foresight and unparalleled enlightenment means they are unlikely to interfere in the business of individual mortals, though the rare person who captures the attention of a gold dragon is fortunate indeed, for there are few beings in the cosmos who can offer such prudent and considerate advice. Rulers and individuals in stations of high power have an easier time of garnering the aid of a gold dragon; entire wars have been avoided thanks to a gold dragon's last-minute intermediation. Gold dragons are often found in warm grasslands and savannas, lands where they can enjoy long, meditative flights without attracting the attention of potential enemies. They tend to sleep either out in the open in a barren, remote place, or within a heavily secreted or fortified lair, such as a forgotten sink hole or in the labyrinthine caverns of a terrestrial chasm. Gold dragons may enlist trusted servants and allies to guard their lairs, though many live truly solitary lives, preferring to protect their hoards with nonlethal traps and magical wards.","Dragon, Gold",20
Ancient Green Dragon,"Green dragons are the most contemplative of the chromatic dragons as well as the most approachable. The key to understanding green dragons is to understand their obsession with knowledge and self-discipline. Any careful approach that takes advantage of a green dragon’s fixations may end in a diplomatic outcome, but any misstep or slight can provoke a savage attack. Like most chromatic dragons, green dragons do not suffer fools—and the threshold for what they consider foolish is very low. Though more open than their chromatic cousins to dealing with other creatures and dragons, green dragons prefer an isolated and quiet life. They tend to lair in the most forbidding parts of a forest, surrounded by tangled thickets, or else at the heart of some dismal gulch. If the terrain is suitable, some green dragons make their home in natural caves, which they expand to suit their needs. Green dragons’ pride leads them to see to the preservation of their forest homes. They feel that a verdant and lush forest is something that they alone have cultivated. This leads some green dragons to follow the path of druidism, though most prefer to study the arcane arts and occult lore. Most of them delve deeply into one particular field of study, and correspond with other scholars in the field by adopting a pen name that hides their true nature. Regardless of their chosen focus, green dragons seek to improve themselves, and their desire for knowledge makes them more likely to deal diplomatically with other creatures in order to obtain new information. Their hoards are typically well kept, organized, and filled with tomes of lore and scrolls of magic along with antiquities they collect for their own inscrutable reasons. Many of these treasures come from across the globe, and many an adventurer has survived an encounter with a green dragon by stroking its ego and plying it with rare artifacts or lost lore from ancient cultures.","Dragon, Green",17
Ancient Magma Dragon,"Magma dragons have a reputation among other dragons for being unpredictable and brash. Their temperament and tendency for violent outbursts ensure that the typical magma dragon lives a solitary life, with hatchlings often bickering or fighting to establish dominance among themselves before they leave the nest. A magma dragon always has a reason for their outbursts and can always justify their sudden turns in mood, yet they rarely feel the need to do so.Magma dragons build lairs within volcanically active mountains or deep underground amid vast lakes of bubbling magma. As with all true dragons, magma dragons keep hoards of treasure, but the nature of their searing lairs limits the type of valuables they collect to metals, gems, and items capable of resisting the heat of a volcano's core.","Dragon, Magma",18
Ancient Red Dragon,"The largest and most powerful of the chromatic dragons, red dragons are a menace to civilizations everywhere, and their strength is rivaled only by their arrogance. Red dragons see themselves as regents and overlords of all dragonkind. With their crowns of crimson spikes and their command of blistering frame, this is no haughty boast in their eyes—only unquestioned fact. Red dragons don’t deign to speak with lesser creatures; they simply dominate and burn, enslaving weaker creatures to act as servants and to look after their lairs while the dragons slumber away. They take pleasure in dominating these creatures, and they demand tribute from their supplicants. Those who anger or disappoint end up eaten or reduced to ash. They command their enslaved minions to constantly build onto their lairs, carving out new tunnels and designing cunning traps that ensure the dragon’s security. Driven by their arrogance, red dragons are the most likely of the chromatic dragons to ravage settlements. They want the world to see them in their rightful place as powerful tyrants, and they delight in threatening all other creatures. They have no qualms about bullying, manipulating, or killing to complete their goals—or simply intimidating others through a public display of brutality and dominance. As legendary as the brutishness of red dragons is the magnificence of their hoards of gold. Their lairs are often situated in dangerous places, with volcanoes being a favorite spot, as they find them foreboding and the constant warmth is comfortable. No matter the locale, red dragons sleep on a litter of coins and other treasures, which they zealously guard. Sometimes, the dragon’s internal heat causes these precious metals to fuse together.","Dragon, Red",19

Ancient Sea Dragon,"Sea dragons' affinity with water grants them mastery over rain, storms, and floods. Those whose livelihoods are at the mercy of the weather and waves frequently venerate these great aquatic creatures. Most sea dragons respond kindly to requests, but, like the sea, they can be unpredictable and fickle. Sea dragons have disk-shaped scales like fish and webbed claws as well as large back and tail fins to aid in swimming. They appear in vivid and vibrant colors, like aquatic wildlife. Underwater flora and fauna grow and thrive upon older sea dragons, and ancient sea dragons often have a head of coral around their antlers, giving them the image of being crowned royalty.","Dragon, Sea",17
Ancient Silver Dragon,"Silver dragons are among the most chivalrous of all dragonkind; they wield frost and cold as weapons, can walk on clouds, and dwell high upon snowy mountain peaks or deep in steep, misty valleys. Although they typically make their lairs among the highlands, the pursuit of justice leads silver dragons to travel far and wide—often into the very heart of realms overrun by evil. These exemplars of righteousness are ceaseless in their determination to help the weak, spread honor, and stamp out evil. Silver dragons are sleek and sinuous. Their hides resemble nothing so much as a suit of gleaming armor, lending further credence to the popular myth that silver dragons are the paladins of dragonkind. The zeal with which they seek out, confront, and defeat evil is unsurpassed even among their metallic cousins, and they adhere to strict codes of honor usually passed down from parent to hatchling. On occasion, they instead learn these codes from trusted mentors, usually other silver dragons or gold dragons. As they age, they become even more dedicated to their codes, often adding new and even more restrictive clauses to the systems that guide their behavior. Silver dragons are incredibly altruistic and regularly consort with the citizens of goodly societies, of which they consider themselves protectors and guides. In addition to responding to evil threats, silver dragons work to prevent evil from taking root in the first place, and they ensure mortals under their care are well fed, educated, and treated with dignity. Although silver dragons can seem overzealous or even eager to join the fight against evil, they know that the best way to rid the world of corruption is to stamp out strife and disillusionment at their source, not to passively sit back and watch it grow into an unsolvable problem. Silver dragons can be vindictive, but they can also be forgiving; for evildoers who seek to atone for their sins and turn over a new leaf, the support of a silver dragon is both unwavering and invaluable. Many silver dragons are also drawn to religious endeavors, venerating deities such as Iomedae, Sarenrae, and other deities concerned with justice, virtue, and redemption.","Dragon, Silver",19
Ancient Sky Dragon,"Sky dragons live above the clouds near the summits of mountains. They maintain a strong religious tradition, a unique practice among imperial dragons that sets them apart as much as their wings do. Desperate souls risk steep cliffs and loose snow to seek these dragons' counsel, and most sky dragons gladly help those who make the journey, but they expel any express hostilities or badger without hesitation. The sky dragon's wings aren't true wings, but long fins fused to their forearms; their scales also form only very slowly. Young dragons coil tightly in their lairs as they absorb minerals that color and harden their scales. Even adults often wrap around pillars out of habit.","Dragon, Sky",18
Ancient Sovereign Dragon,"The most well-known of imperial dragons due to their deep involvement with mortals, the sovereign dragons' name comes from their mandate of selecting rulers—but at some point, the dragons themselves joined the list of worthy candidates. Other imperial dragons suspect the sovereign dragons offered their connection to the elemental cycle to attain forbidden magic, evidenced by their lack of any vulnerability to wood or ability to feed on fire, despite being creatures of the earth. Most hesitate to question the sovereigns' authority. While some appreciate their impartial nature, others fault this adherence to neutrality. Regardless, the sovereign dragons' charm and centuries of experience in subtle manipulation have made them exceptional negotiators. Almost all sovereign dragons appear gold in color. Their hair ranges from common colors found among humans to bright reds, greens, or blues. They're the only dragons with five digits per claw, a mark of special importance. Other imperial dragons dismiss this claim to status and instead tease the sovereign dragons over their need to wear armor, even while in their draconic forms.","Dragon, Sovereign",20
Ancient Umbral Dragon,"While the other primal dragons hail from the Elemental Planes, the cruel and unceasingly malicious umbral dragons originate in the depths of the Shadow Plane. Their sleek black scales and serpentine grace allow them to strike from hiding, and they are known for playing with their prey before finally finishing it. These creatures of shadowy energy and unwholesome appetites prefer the necrotic flesh of undead creatures to any other meal. This strange hunger can be of accidental benefit to nearby humanoid societies, but ultimately they hunt and kill undead creatures for the taste, rather than out of any desire to protect others from the undead. The benefit is always short-lived, however. When umbral dragons exhaust their preferred prey, they turn on whatever living creatures happen to be nearby. Umbral dragons sometimes go to great lengths to obtain their favorite meals, even creating undead creatures that they then feast upon.For all their power, umbral dragons are uninterested in fair battles. When faced with foes that pose any kind of actual danger to them, umbral dragons flee into the shadows and seek to strike back through pawns or minions rather than risk their own lives. Their treasure hoards are varied and diverse, often augmented by loot stolen from crypts the dragons have turned into feeding grounds. They have a strong respect for and interest in traditions and heirlooms, and they often seek to augment their hoards with items of great value that have been handed down through the generations of those whose corpses and ghosts they've fed upon.","Dragon, Umbral",20
Ancient Underworld Dragon,"Underworld dragons embody the pressure between tectonic plates, the heat behind geysers, and flash fires that ignite when the conditions are just right. Natural alchemists, they innately understand reagents and catalysts. While some research the effects of magic on material reactions, the majority of underworld dragons concentrate on building their hoards. They scour the world for carved gemstones and artifacts of precious minerals, both of which they see as distilled essence of earth's bounty. Underworld dragons appear angular and sharp; their scales glow as if superheated from within, and their hair flickers like tongues of flames. An intense fire glows behind their gazes, suggesting they could ignite items with a mere thought, and their breath ripples the air as a testament to the heat contained within their bodies.","Dragon, Underworld",16
Ancient White Dragon,"The most feral and least intelligent of all the chromatic dragons, white dragons are brutish, predatory, and chiefly motivated by self-preservation. Nearly all other dragons look down on white dragons as hopelessly hotheaded and dull, though this does not make them any less dangerous—in fact, it may mean the opposite. It’s nearly impossible to treat with white dragons, not because they lack the capacity to do so, but because they just don’t care to. They are as difficult to deal with as they are quick to anger, and they become incensed at almost anything. When a white dragon does speak, it spews threats, inane jokes, and incoherent babbling as a prelude to attacking—and when the attack comes, it’s bloody and relentless. Thankfully, white dragons prefer very cold, remote locations that are far from people. Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds. They fly out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass near the dragon’s territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference for items with high utility—such as tools, trade goods, and fine food—over coins or jewels. The ability to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly to their specifications, and they take great pride in how they’ve decorated their homes over the years.","Dragon, White",15
Android Infiltrator,"Androids possess synthetic bodies inhabited by living souls. These technological organisms first came to Golarion from another world when their starship crashed, scattering wreckage all across Numeria in an event known as the Rain of Stars. Feared by local Kellids and enslaved by the Technic League, androids on Golarion have spent eons being hated and hunted. Many androids survive by adopting human customs and hiding in plain sight, while others become criminals, hermits, or nomads. Designed to resemble humans, androids have several distinctive features. Their eyes have a metallic sheen, they rarely fall ill, and they have trouble displaying complex emotions. Circuit-like tattoos decorate their bodies and control internal nanites. When stimulated, these nanites kick their internal chemistry into overdrive, allowing them to function at peak performance that causes their circuitry to glow. Androids are created in sophisticated machines called foundries. They emerge as mature adults with newborn souls and no knowledge of their purpose or the world around them. Android bodies don't deteriorate, though their souls age like any other mortal's. When an android feels they've lived a full life, they willingly release their soul to the afterlife, causing their body to shut down and reboot. Once this process, known as Renewal, completes, a new soul inhabits the body. Foundry programming produces androids that mimic human anatomy. Numerous android models exist, each designed to excel at different tasks and purposes. Androids of all models display countless variations of coloration, body shapes, and gender identities. Theoretically, a foundry could be reprogrammed to create androids with new adaptations, colorations, and forms—perhaps even in the guise of other ancestries.",Android,2
Anemos,"The truth of life in the Universe is that weather controls the world. The life-giving water that flows across Golarion, the maintenance of healthy forests, and the snows, thaws, and rains that help crops flourish all rely on the weather—weather that's shaped at the whims of the winds. Anemoi are powerful beings from the Plane of Air tasked by ancient gods to guard the skies and shepherd the winds of every world across the planes. They guide the winds along their natural paths, and while neither malevolent nor malicious, an anemos has little regard for how a storm might affect any creature caught in its path. Anemoi can take several forms and shift between them as easily as they slip between the breezes. They wear humanoid guises to walk among mortals without drawing undue attention, and they transform into great, thunderous horses made of storm clouds and rain when they need to move quickly across the skies. Their true form, however, is wind coalesced into a humanoid shape, often with curling hair and feathery wings made of soft, drifting clouds. On Golarion, each of the four cardinal winds are created and directed by a quartet of cardinal anemoi. The cold north winds are guided by Boreal, bringer of winter. Austral shepherds hot winds from the south. Eural brings stormy winds from the east. Finally, the gentle winds of spring come at the call of Zephyr, from the west. These four cardinal anemoi, alongside their councils of lesser anemoi, shape and control the winds across all of Golarion. As far as anyone can tell, the cardinal anemoi don't answer to a greater authority. There are even more powerful maximal anemoi living in the Plane of Air, but they seem content to leave the Universe out of their plans. Though the cardinal anemoi try to keep a degree of separation from mortal affairs, lesser anemoi occasionally take a closer interest. Some monitor a single settlement or county, protecting, nourishing, or even vindictively destroying it. Each one has their own sets of interests. Many are vain or petty. Even more change attitudes just as quickly as the winds they guide. Pleasing an anemoi isn't a matter of following a set formula, but rather repeatedly changing course to give them what they desire for their mercurial current interests or perceived needs.",,18
Angazhani,"Angazhanis lurk in the depths of the world's jungles, where these sapient, four-armed apes prey on any creatures they deem lesser than themselves. They're purportedly the divine minions of Angazhan, demon lord of apes. While many angazhanis do worship this foul god, scarce evidence exists to support their claim to fiendish heritage. Jungle-dwelling people know well to steer clear of suspected angazhani territories; angazhanis of such areas don't slaughter outright, often capturing trespassers to serve as slaves or as living sacrifices in heinous rituals.",,8
Angheuvore Flesh-Gnawer,"Angheuvores, or mortic elves, have an insatiable hunger for raw humanoid flesh— though they're reluctant to feed on other elves. Most stalk the streets of human nations, such as Druma, Razmiran, and the River Kingdoms. Impatient and impulsive, they're opportunistic hunters, preying on the wounded and isolated.",Mortic,2
Angoyang,"Angoyangs resemble white cats with black stripes like those of a tiger. They have beautifully silken fur, piercing blue eyes, and long fluffy tails. Yet, far from the picturesque feline companions they appear to be, angoyangs are actually terrifying beasts capable of peeling back the fleshy layers of their face to reveal a mass of long, toothed tentacles. Although most cats instinctively avoid areas where angoyangs roam, the unlucky felines who do encounter this creature are invariably entangled in the monster's toothy tentacles and devoured. In cities and towns where angoyangs reside, cat owners may find that their beloved pets have gone missing only to soon have a fluffy black-and-white cat coincidentally appear at their doorstep, looking up at them with wide eyes and mewing adorably. Angoyangs almost never attack their caretakers, who they see as loyal servants that feed, clean up after, and pamper them, and the creatures protect the people in their household from any would-be intruders. However, a caretaker who mistreats or neglects their angoyang ward is often met with a grisly fate. More than one coroner or gravedigger has inadvertently inherited an angoyang after being assigned to clean up the mutilated remains of a previous “owner.”",,14
Animate Dream,"An animate dream coalesces from centuries of stray fragments of reverie and dream left behind as slumbering minds drift through the Dimension of Dreams. In most cases, these fragments simply disperse on their own, but when dreamers flee from nightmares back to the waking world, these fragments can take on a supernatural life of their own. They have little reasoning and intent except to seek similar fragments, absorb them, and grow. When enough of them gather together, they merge into a horrific form as an animate dream.Individually, animate dreams can hold a wide range of appearances, but most take on rudimentary shapes akin to the living forms of the minds that spawned them. Animate dreams that rise from slumbering humanoids, the most commonly encountered, thus appear humanoid, but with distorted, nightmarish shapes that incorporate additional twisted limbs and frightening features. In these forms, animate dreams find their way out of the Dreamlands and into the waking world, only to discover they have no way of returning and suffer a relentless hunger that only new nightmares can sate.An animate dream thrives on the terror fueled by nightmares and fear and uses its supernatural abilities to invoke such feelings in the minds of its victims, cursing its prey by creating a permanent link to that individual's dreams. Thereafter, the victim is subjected to all manner of reoccurring nightmares. As the nightmares continue, the victim finds it more and more difficult to remain awake. In the end, the victim plunges into an accursed slumber from which it cannot return. These victims provide the animate dream with the purest form of fear and are its preferred sustenance.An animate dream can subsist on the ambient fear generated by regular nightmares, but these lesser fears aren't as satisfying, often driving the animate dream to seek out new victims. Left without a source of fear, an animate dream won't starve to death, but it will grow increasingly violent and desperate. Famished animate dreams are the ones most often encountered, as they have been forced to abandon subtlety to pursue more blatant methods of harvesting fear. Yet such animate dreams also tend to be the least powerful of their kind. Those who have grown metaphysically fat on fear have generally done so by adopting a specific nightmare theme, such as being buried alive, being swept away by ocean waves, or being consumed by wild beasts. Such animate dreams often have similarly themed innate spells to augment their powers.",,8

Ankhrav,"These horse-sized, burrowing monsters generally avoid heavily settled areas like cities, but ankhravs’ predilection for livestock and humanoid flesh ensures that the creatures do not remain in the deep wilderness for long. Desperate farmers whose fields become infested by ankhravs often have little recourse but to seek the aid of adventurers.

Ankou,"Ankous are shadowy killers who serve powerful fey creatures, or even the Eldest— the demigods of the First World. Amid the courts of the Eldest or of powerful fey rulers, these sinister assassins lurk overhead as they await the call to action—implied threats akin to deadly weapons hung as decor in a royal hall. Ankous never speak aloud; when they feel the need to communicate at all, they do so in a telepathic whisper directly into a victim's mind. While an ankou's body is made of strange, fleshy material, their claws and the cruel hooks on their wings are made of razor-sharp cold iron, a quality that makes them much feared among other fey. A typical ankou is 10 feet tall and has an 8-foot wingspan but weighs less than 80 pounds.While most ankous serve powerful masters, some of these murderous fey are left to their own devices and serve none but their own capricious, cruel whims. In some cases, their master may have been slain, while in others the ankou may have been released from service for any number of reasons. An ankou left to indulge their own whims unrestrained is often the most dangerous ankou of them all!",,14
Ankylosaurus,"Squat, heavily armored quadrupeds, ankylosauruses are stubborn and irascible. Although they’re herbivores, they have been known to attack other creatures that trespass within territory simply out of ill temper. Ankylosauruses have few natural predators, as their bony hides are covered in spiked nubs that jut in many different directions to discourage larger creatures from biting them. They have mighty tails ending in an immense knot of bone, which they use to whip at threats with incredible speed and power. While these low-to-the-ground dinosaurs can trample human-sized or smaller foes, their relatively squat stance prevents them from doing so against larger targets. An ankylosaurus is about 30 feet long, 10 feet tall at the shoulder, and weighs over 3 tons. The ankylosaurus is the largest of the heavily armored dinosaurs called ankylosaurids, but smaller versions exist as well. Still Large in size, these smaller dinosaurs, such as the 16-foot long pinacosaurus, lack the trample ability and are rarely above 4th level. Regardless of size, ankylosaurids tend to be relatively muted in coloration, with mixes of black, brown, and gray. When captive, an ankylosaurus’s keeper might paint its scales bright colors to signify to others that is not a wild creature.",Dinosaur,6
Annis Hag,"Annis hags are brutal torturers and murderers, delighting in the musical screams and tasty flesh of young creatures and those who are pure of heart. Annis hags are the most direct of all hags, engaging in physical combat and using their change shape ability to hunt rather than to infiltrate and betray humanoids. But an Annis hag takes a grisly trophy from each kill and uses it to sow discord, sending the trophy to one of her victim’s loved ones in a way that implicates another family member in the murder. Also known as iron hags, annis hags have iron-like yet flexible flesh that resists edged weapons, and their own touch is the same cold iron that burns the flesh of other hags. This allows them to bully their way to the leadership of hag covens.",Hag,6
Antipaladin,"There is perhaps nothing more anathematic to peace than an antipaladin.

But an anugobu does not earn the honorable title of wondercrafter until they find their own wonder. Once they discover and finish such a wonder, the anugobu is considered fully mature.

Regardless of the specific creature an aolaz has been constructed to resemble, it is not bound to walk the earth like its inspirations are—it's imbued with the magical ability to pursue across water and even through the air.

Aphorite Sharpshooter,"The denizens of the Eternal City of Axis first forged aphorites to serve as emissaries, agents, and facilitators, with one foot in the sublime, perfect order of the Plane of Law, and one in the messy, murky, confusing muck of the Material Plane. In time, aphorites spread across the length and breadth of Golarion. Today they can be found in any corner of any land, and only a fraction still serve Axis directly. Aphorites, like all planar scions, stand out quite vividly from their fellow mortals, sporting metallic skin, a faint coating of crystalline dust, a swirl of mathematical symbols, or perfectly symmetrical features. Many aphorites think logically and find satisfaction in careers dealing with numbers and information. Often, this leads them to become bookkeepers, clerks, or architects, but some become military engineers or sharpshooters. Others are drawn to the art of production, becoming blacksmiths, carpenters, engineers, architects, tailors, masons, or other such artisans. But no matter their careers, aphorites often feel the urge to tinker, and aphorite inventions draws both mockery and appreciation in equal measure. Aphorites who work in less academic professions, such as mercenaries or laborers, sometimes hide their keen analytical intelligence beneath extravagant demeanors and flamboyant hats. Some craft even these disguises with the same depth and complexity they do others aspect of their lives, considering every theatrical mannerism carefully and planning out their every detail.",Planar Scion,4

Arboreal Archive,"Arboreal archives are solitary beings typically found in the remote wilderness. These ancient monoliths hold the memories of their vast territories, keeping mental records of the passing seasons of the world around them. Their knowledge of humanoid affairs varies, as they find quickly shifting political situations difficult to comprehend, but through fungal networks, reports from arboreal wardens, and other woodland chatter, arboreal archives learn of each storm, drought, or logging threat encountered throughout their long years. They primarily observe and record rather than interfere, but they willingly offer wisdom to those who respectfully seek them out. Arboreal regents call upon archives for advice in times of strife, conferring on the best course of action to protect their realms. It is rare for there to be more than one arboreal archive in a given region. When an archive senses they're nearing the end of their lengthy lifespan, a grove of regents gathers to nominate the wisest among them to become the next archive. After four seasons' deliberation, all arboreals in the area congregate to witness the succession ritual, during which the elder arboreal archive transfers their collected wisdom to the elected replacement before retiring.",Arboreal,12
Arboreal Reaper,"While some forests have an idyllic, peaceful quality to them, others feel distinctly unfriendly or even sinister—these forests are the favored haunts of arboreal reapers. Sometimes these woodlands are sought out by secretive practitioners of malicious arts who claim the unsettling ambiance aids their abilities; arboreal reapers see no reason to interfere with such practices as long as the balance of their forests isn't harmed. All arboreals vary in appearance based on their surroundings, but arboreal reapers always seem vaguely eerie, whether they watch over a grim weald or a tropical rain forest. Often slightly warped, twisted, and covered in spiky protrusions, arboreal reapers sometimes sprout around old ruins or other permanent structures, breaking down and incorporating the structures as they mature and become more mobile. Arboreal reapers focus on the essential decaying phase of a forest's life cycle, becoming especially active in autumn and winter seasons. Their influence can often be seen in the explosion of mushrooms on a rotting log or the enticing fronds of a flourishing carnivorous plant. Like arboreal wardens, these woodland guardians are quicker to react to perceived threats than the more deliberate regents or retiring archives—at least by arboreal standards.",Arboreal,7
Arboreal Regent,"Arboreal regents—also called treants—are lumbering, solitary creatures responsible for guarding an entire forest. They take an especially long view of affairs and never act brashly or without much deliberation. They occasionally come together in small groups called groves to share news and pass their wisdom down to the arboreal wardens that have sprouted under their watch. In times of grave danger, all the groves in a region may gather for a great months-long meeting to plan and, eventually, act upon a threat.The typical arboreal regent is 30 feet tall, has a trunk 2 feet in diameter, and weighs 4,500 pounds.",Arboreal,8
Arboreal Snag,"Arboreals can be victims of undeath like any other living creature, but without bones or flesh, their undead take a different form. When an arboreal shivers to life as undead, it often animates as a snag—a leafless, skeletal dead tree that haunts its forest, attacking any living creature it can catch. An arboreal snag is mindless and difficult to control, but some necromancers use them as forest guardians. While many arboreals are comfortable remaining still for prolonged periods of time, arboreal snags tend to be restless, meandering in a region they consider their domain. This territory is sometimes evident from battered forest animals or trampled undergrowth that litters the ground, but forest creatures soon learn to avoid the area entirely. It doesn't take long for regions haunted by arboreal snags to grow desolate and unhealthy, and locals often dub such regions as haunted or cursed. Variant Arboreal Snags Like skeletons and zombies, snags can demonstrate variant abilities. You can remove the arboreal snag's Putrid Sap to give it one of these other abilities instead. Blood Roots (necromancy, primal) The snag's roots go deep into corpses buried beneath and around it. It has regeneration 5 (deactivated by positive) as long as it remains in an area where corpses are buried. Death Blossom  [two-actions]  (manipulate, necromancy, poison, primal) The snag shakes branches covered in sickly flowers, showering all creatures within reach of its branch Strike with poisonous pollen, dealing 3d6 poison damage (DC 20 basic Fortitude save). If the snag is critically hit, it can use Death Blossom as a reaction.",,3
Arboreal Warden,"Arboreal wardens are the rangers of arboreal society. These itinerant folk have an innate curiosity about the woodlands in which they dwell, and rarely stop to take root and rest in the same part of the forest twice. This wanderlust makes wardens ideal forest patrollers and scouts. While they are robust combatants, they know better than to confront dangerous foes on their own. Instead, they report any dangers to arboreal regents. In rare cases, large groups of arboreal wardens congregate to form a copse. Copses travel beyond the boundaries of a forest to investigate the hinterlands and gather intelligence on potential threats before returning to report their findings. Arboreal wardens do not pretend to understand to other creatures’ motives—like most forces of the natural world, they are ambivalent about mortal affairs that do not involve their forest.",Arboreal,4
Arcane Living Rune,"The most famous living runes are those of the ancient Runelords of Thassilon, resurging as Thassilon rebuilds in the modern era.

Ardande Gardner,"Ardandes are geniekin whose elemental birthright ties them to the Plane of Wood. Their elemental connection can take many different forms, all expressions of the different types and permutations of elemental wood. They might embody the life and vibrancy of a seedling, full of potential and ready to grow. Or, they could be strong and flexible, like the branches and roots of ancient trees, interconnected and all growing together. They could also possess power over death and decay, like decomposing logs ready to fertilize and feed the next generation. Common on the Plane of Wood, uncommon in the First World, and only on the cusp of a resurgence into the Universe, the ardandes often feel misplaced in the multiverse, born into the wrong place or the wrong time. Many spend their lives searching the planes for answers about themselves and their heritage. Ardandes are found in all major cities and civilizations on the Plane of Wood, though most live in Nodollin, the Glowing Infinity, a metropolis controlled by the powerful kizidhars. Some ardandes say life in Nodollin is filled with infantilization and belittlement from the kizidhars, the wood genies who rule the land and much of the plane. The kizidhars largely view ardandes as genies like them, but a lesser form of genie that ranks below kizidhar commoners in the same way they are lesser to the shuyookhs. Though a few ardandes rebel against this social order, the weight of culture tells them hierarchies are natural to the element of wood, and they should accept their place even if they chafe. Many planar ardandes moved to Shodokar when the new city was founded, hoping the influx of portals leading out of the Plane of Wood would let them visit the rest of the multiverse and learn about their lost mortal heritage. They delight in meeting visitors and showing off the beauty and wonders of their home plane. Some have even moved to the Universe, and they make invaluable mentors for the new ardandes only just discovering their elemental potential across Golarion.",Planar Scion,1

Asp Of Grief,"On the Plane of Metal, a soft whisper and gentle jingle often accompany the tempestuous winds, while what appear to be gold ribbons twist and writhe through the air. In actuality, these are asps of grief—intelligent, snakelike creatures drawn to strong emotions. The iron irises of their eyes allow them to see the ever-shifting magnetic fields of the Plane of Metal, which the asps can use to sail across the skies. Asps of grief prey on sorrow and heartache, and times of loss, mourning, and bereavement attract them. Wearing delicate iron bells to announce their arrivals at funerals, battlefields, and the traditional columbaria built for the plane's dead, asps of grief shake their heads, making their bells chime and alerting mourners to their presence. “Will you share your sorrow with me?” they ask, their gentle voices low and sibilant. If the bereaved agrees, the asps' tongues flick out, tasting the anguish of the living, sipping on sadness and fear, and providing a temporary reprieve from suffering. Though the asps are associated with death, most denizens of the Plane of Metal see them as good omens. Intensely curious creatures, asps of grief crave information about magic and the multiverse. They might attach themselves to adventuring parties or ask wanderers they meet for any obscure arcane knowledge they may have come across on their journeys. In exchange, the asps of grief offer to help these travelers work through any anguish or trauma they may be carrying— or at least ease their emotional pain for a time.",,10
Assassin,"Assassins commit murder, either for pay or due to their belief in a cause, such as a religion or a political movement. Some assassins work alone and choose their own victims. Others are members of assassins' guilds, organizations that accept contracts to kill in return for money, favors, or both.",Criminals,8
Assassin Vine,"The assassin vine is a carnivorous plant with a voracious appetite. Rather than consuming creatures directly, it creates its own fertilizer by entangling prey and squeezing the life from it. Once the plant has killed a creature, it pulls the carcass over to its roots to feed from the decaying flesh. Although an assassin vine lacks eyes, it can detect and track prey through a combination of using its root systems to detect vibrations through topsoil and its leaves to detect heat changes in the vicinity. Although the assassin vine has no real intelligence, its learned behaviors mimic those of cunning ambush hunters.As it is slow moving, the assassin vine typically remains rooted in a single area for as long as it has sufficient prey. Though most often found along woodland trails or swamps, these plants can also be encountered in more rural settlements, poorly tended fields, and vineyards. While assassin vines can't be trained in the classical sense, they can be used as defenses, and woodland-dwelling creatures like goblins and fey have been known to cultivate assassin vines as guardians for less-used routes into their lairs. In such cases, the tenders often seek to make the path more obvious than its disuse would otherwise suggest, while simultaneously working to ensure the bones of the vines' victims are removed to keep their presence a secret, resulting in what appears to be an easy approach to the den but is actually an organic ambush.Mature assassin vines grow to 20 feet long and have smaller vines extending off the main trunk that reach from to 5 to 10 feet in length. The smallest of these vines sprout every 6 inches or so; they tend to grow clusters of full leaves and occasionally bear small berries. A recently fed assassin vine can have bunches of plump, blood-red berries that are juicy and tart but leave a slightly unpleasant iron aftertaste, as if from the faint taste of blood from a bitten lip.",,3
Astradaemon,"These unnerving, almost reptilian daemons represent death by direct assault against a soul or life-force—the same numbing death they bring with their fell touch. Rarely seen on the Material Plane, astradaemons spend most of their time hunting the pathways between the living world and the afterlife. There, they capture migrating souls, snatching them from their rightful rewards or punishments and dragging them to Abaddon as tribute to their undying masters. These horrifying predators of the dead can also be found stalking the banks of the River of Souls in the Astral Plane, where they constantly hunt for new victims. Psychopomps have a particular hatred of astradaemons as a result, and clashes between them and these eerie hunters of the recently departed are indeed the stuff of legend. Not all astradaemons limit their hunt to souls. The most notorious of their kind serve the Horsemen themselves as assassins.",Daemon,16
Astral Deva,"Astral devas are the elite messengers and emissaries of the celestial realms, serving deities and celestial armies by delivering messages, performing reconnaissance, and providing support for those in need of aid. They watch over planar travelers and take powerful mortals under their wings to mentor them. Astral devas carry scrolls containing important messages and other celestial secrets.Astral devas can form spontaneously from the souls of exceptional good-aligned mortals, but are also sometimes created from such souls intentionally by deities or demigods. In the later cases, astral devas often bear physical features that mark them as closely affiliated with that deity. An astral deva created by Sarenrae, for example, might have hair made of fire, while one created by Torag might look more dwarven, and one created by Desna could have butterfly wings instead of feathered wings. It’s not unusual for astral devas created by lawful good or chaotic good deities to share their creators’ alignment.",Angel,14
Astronomer,"Different cultures have created stories of the hows and whys of the universe, if things exist beyond the stars, and if the gods manipulate the heavenly bodies. But astronomers aren't interested in folktales—they desire truth.",Scholars,2
Athach,"The towering and brutish giants known as athaches are reviled for both their monstrosity and their cruelty. Beyond an athach's filthy habits, this giant is made stranger by the gangly third arm that protrudes from their torso and ends in a twitching, long-fingered claw. Huge, tusk-like fangs descend from an athach's upper jaw and prop their mouth open, leaking long strands of viscous drool that is itself is a toxic venom and coats the athach's fangs.Athachs despise civilization almost as much as they despise their own kind, and they delight in committing sadistic acts and terrorizing victims. An athach does not keep a traditional territory of their own, but rather wanders the hinterlands of settled territories until they find a suitably easy settlement of smaller humanoids to target. Once the athach has chosen their target, the giant establishes a hidden lair in a location like an abandoned farmhouse or cave, and from there they launch their reign of torment. After a few weeks of harassing, capturing, and torturing victims, the athach bores of their games. The giant then goes on a final rampage, destroying every dwelling and eating every creature they can find. Sometimes, the giant allows a survivor or two to escape, forcing these terrified victims to spend the rest of their lives spreading word of the athach's fearsomeness.",,12
Attic Whisperer,"Beware the haunting sobs of the attic whisperer, for they carry the pained wrath of an abandoned child who perished due to the neglect or absence of their caretakers. Animated by loneliness, the embittered spirit binds itself to the material world in a body made of bits and oddments of a lost childhood—wooden blocks, scraps of blankets, ratty dolls, buttons, carved trinkets, and glass marbles. To give themselves the semblance of a head, they top their patchwork bodies with a small animal's skull.Attic whisperers most frequently lurk in old infirmaries, orphanages, and other such institutions where children were forgotten, and they lay dormant for decades in hopes that they might one day find a playmate to ease their eternal loneliness. When they sense the living, attic whisperers attempt to lure them into their clutches by calling out to them using the voice of a small child. Though attic whisperers intend only to play with those they encounter, they drain the breath and voice from living creatures as their dark impulses take over.",,4
Augnagar,"The brutish and gluttonous augnagar live to feast— preferably on rotten flesh, and when possible, demon flesh. But to them, the greatest delicacy is the flesh of other augnagars. Augnagars have spiderlike legs with leathery membranes like a bat's wings, and three tails ending in hooked claws perfect for slicing flesh.",Qlippoth,14
Augur,"These spherical knots of sinewy muscle, serrated blades, and bloody metal are the most common velstracs on the Shadow Plane. Each augur has only a single eye, from which they can see the horrors inflicted by other velstracs, who train the augur to expect and appreciate pain. Augurs are 1 foot in diameter and weigh 30 pounds.",Velstrac,1
Aurumvorax,"Aurumvoraxes are highly aggressive and territorial predators that sprint on eight legs, using their terrific strength and iron-hard claws to dig through solid stone. A typical aurumvorax is only 3 feet long but weighs more than 200 pounds, for its thick, sturdy bones are densely packed with muscle, making the creature very strong but a notoriously poor swimmer. Its fur is golden, sometimes with a silvery or russet tone depending on the metals it has ingested, and its claws are always the shiny black of seasoned iron.Aurumvorax adults claim hunting territories spanning a mile or more, driving out other predators and leading solitary lives except when they mate. They are irascible creatures, impossible to train as adults, but daring trainers can rear aurumvorax pups as deadly guard beasts, which they sell for hundreds of gold pieces to discriminating buyers. Aurumvorax pups are usually single births, and their mothers are fiercely protective, making their acquisition a dangerous proposition. Even when trained, the creatures are prone to dangerous bursts of rage.",,9
Avalanche Legion,"Elementals of the Plane of Earth can be fiercely territorial. Some more solitary elementals protect their lairs on their own, but occasionally others band together to defend larger regions that serve as shared turf. Notable among these alliances are avalanche legions, who patrol the perimeter of these shared territories, driving off intruders who dare to trespass upon their home ground.",,11
Avarek,"Avareks delight in tormenting ship's crews and causing shipwrecks off the coasts of Garund and the Inner Sea. Bipedal, aquatic fey covered in long, urchin-like spines, avareks stand 2 feet tall—or 3 feet tall if measured to the tips of their spines—and weigh fewer than 30 pounds. Avareks rely on subtlety and subterfuge to indulge their destructive whims, using magic to sabotage ships and cloud the minds of crew members and passengers. Patient and cunning, avareks lurk beneath or within a targeted vessel for weeks, building conflict and mistrust. Soon, shipmates accuse one another of theft and treachery; superstitious crew members might believe their ship is haunted. Eventually, the crew becomes too frightened or mistrustful to save their ship from the avareks' sabotage. Avareks take pride in their sunken trophies, claiming the wrecks of ships they've destroyed as their homes and gorging on the bloated, water-logged corpses of the crew and passengers.",,8
Awakened Tree,"Arboreal regents and other wielders of powerful primal magic grant temporary sentience to trees in order to protect the forest. Invested with a workable set of instincts and the ability to mobilize and attack, these awakened trees follow the commands of their master and fight to protect their home. The statistics below work just as well for foliage that has become animate via other methods, such as a mystical influence from another dimension, a capricious fey spirit, or the like.",Arboreal,6
Axiomite,"According to the axiomites, their kind rose from the raw mathematical underpinnings of the universe, manifesting as great builders who created the ancient, colossal cities of the Outer Planes and gave life to the mechanical inevitables. According to the aeons, axiomites are part of the Monad, having both risen from and rebelled against it long ago. Since the Convergence, most axiomites have recognized this as a fundamental truth, particularly after the aeons showed the axiomites how the Utopian language has formed as an amalgam of aeon envisioning and formulaic mathematical expression. Most axiomites live in the perfect city of Axis, which they continually act to improve, thus refining the concept of perfection itself. A particular axiomite may look like any humanoid creature, though the particular form it takes on does not affect its abilities. Beneath this assumed form, all axiomites are the same—clouds of glowing, crystalline dust that constantly swirls and congeals into complex tangles of symbols and equations, evincing their existence as literal creatures of pure mathematical law. Axiomites arise from the souls of lawful neutral mortals, particularly those who were, in life, mathematicians, architects, crafters, or philosophers. While these souls do not retain any memories of their lives in the transition into axiomites, their life skills and experiences nevertheless serve a valuable metaphysical resource during formation.",Aeon,8
Azarketi Explorer,"This rakish azarketi explores the wrecks and ruins of the Inner Sea's coasts. At home above and below the waves, they fight to protect their discoveries, their life, and their reputation.",Azarketi,2
Azer,"Azers are an elemental people living on the Plane of Fire, often crudely described by mortals as brassy dwarves. They have stout, wide bodies with broad shoulders, shining metallic skin, and heads wreathed in flame. Azer society is organized into traditional roles inherited along their familial lines, and an azer's role is indicated clearly by the metals they wear in their armored kilts. Their culture focuses on tradition and history, placing high value on obedience and conformity within one's community, and as a result it is slow to change. Many azers take pride in their ancestral roles and in fulfilling their inherited duties, providing needed services within their communities. Long ago, traditional azer values of self-sufficiency and close community led them to build mighty fortresses across the Plane of Fire, where they isolated themselves from other planar denizens and even other azer communities. These values, sadly, also led to their downfall. Without any connections to or regular communication with other settlements, these fortresses were easily conquered by the efreet of the City of Brass, the dominant power on the Plane of Fire. Now most azer fortresses lie abandoned and ruined, with free holds so few and far between that most think them all lost. Azers born within the efreeti Dominion of Flame belong to the populations that were conquered and assimilated into the empire ages ago. They live in perpetual service to the empire, disconnected from their history and culture, yet have formed their own close-knit society in the City of Brass under the fire genies' harsh rule. A handful of azer communities have escaped efreeti conquest, most often by fleeing far from the genies' realms. Some of these azers now reside in hot, volcanic areas of the Darklands on the Material Plane, while others have fled to the remote depths within the Plane of Fire or made strange bargains with conniving allies or unknowable entities to keep themselves hidden. Prying outsiders nevertheless perpetually seek out these settlements, longing for legendary azer-crafted goods.",,2
Azmakian Effigy,"Xar-Azmak, the demonic Lord of Rust, was destroyed long ago by Dispater. Some weapons of his infernal legions remain and among the most infamous are Azmakian effigies: fearsome infernal constructs shaped in his image. Although made of iron, an Azmakian effigy's exterior is thick with rust that flakes off as the construct moves and fights. Effigies charge into battle on massive hooves, impaling enemies on long, curving horns. The effigy's most well-known attack—and the ability that makes even the bravest warrior tremble—is their terrible rusting breath, which can reduce even legendary magical weapons to useless scrap. Wise adventurers attempt to fight an effigy at a distance, but these constructs are surprisingly swift and able to outrun many foes. The secret to creating Azmakian effigies is thought to be lost, but infernal libraries might still contain the necessary rituals and list of ingredients. Xar-Azmak once commanded ranks of effigies that numbered in the thousands, but most of those who survived his destruction were trapped in Hell, where they were pursued by Dispater's forces and eventually destroyed. Those few who offered their services to Xar-Azmak's devoted worshippers on Golarion survived this purge. With the death of Xar-Azmak, much of the lore to repair the effigies was lost. When one of these constructs is found, they're often suffering some form of long-term damage.",,7
Azure Worm,"The azure worm is a deep-blue creature that is more at home in flooded tunnels than dry caves. While an azure worm is a strong swimmer, it prefers to lie in wait within the walls, door, or even ceiling of flooded caverns, ready to spring out and ambush creatures swimming past its hiding spot. The azure worm is particularly hated and feared by Darklands-dwelling cultures, due to the fact that an azure worm that burrows into a tunnel often brings with it waters from the submerged river or lake it calls home. When it becomes obvious that an azure worm is near a Darklands settlement, the inhabitants quickly establishing a hunting party to deal with the menace before it can bring ruin.",Cave Worm,15
Azuretzi,"Azuretzis are sinuous, serpentine creatures with dagger-sharp teeth, covered in brilliant blue scales with mottled purple and pink highlights that shimmer in a pareidolic approximation of leering, laughing faces. The Maelstrom's chaotic forces spawn these small proteans from a variety of sources: physical mating between older azuretzis, the paradoxical promotion of bestial naunets, and possibly from mortal petitioners, though azuretzis may just be confusing putative mortal memories with experiences gained from games of mimicry. Never expect azuretzis to operate by any rational, self-consistent rules. Azuretzis represent the humor of chaos, particularly in the form of mockery and parody via exaggerated mimicry, twisting a target's features into a laughingstock.",Protean,5
Ba'aupa Mdoudu,"Ba'aupa mdoudus are solitary, bone-eating creatures that prefer to feed on remains found on battlefields or within necropolises—the more ancient, the better. When unable to locate buried remains, ba'aupa mdoudus are drawn reluctantly to the surface in search of bones from the living; living bones can sustain a ba'aupa mdoudu, but the flavor (particularly the temperature of warm bones fresh from the flesh) unsettles them a bit. Ba'aupa mdoudus produce a slimy acid that liquefies minerals, allowing them to burrow though even solid stone and strip natural deposits of calcium from nearby rocks. In doing so, they leave smooth tunnels in their wake. When provoked, ba'aupa mdoudus secrete this acid through numerous pores along their length as a defensive response and accelerate this secretion under extreme circumstances.",,13
Baatamidar,"Baatamidars are drawn to destroy planar communities on the fringes where the Outer Planes touch the chaos of the Maelstrom. They resemble floating blobs of undulating, prismatic ooze with four quivering tentacles and dribbles of oily slime that always drip upwards.",,21
Babau,"The babau is an assassin, a murderer, and a sadist—certainly not unusual traits, yet their penchant for stealth and surprise sets them apart from their kin. Babaus form from mortal souls of lone killers—those who took pleasure in more personal murders, and particularly those with grisly patterns to their killings.",Demon,6
Badger,"The typical badger has dark, brownish-gray fur highlighted with white markings, particularly on the head, giving it a striped mask of fur around its eyes. A threatened badger can swiftly become a ferocious combatant that typically fights until slain.",Badger,0
Balisse,"Balisses, or confessor angels, seek to assist mortals ensnared by moral dilemmas or crises of faith. Balisses prefer to guide people to their own decisions rather than demand obedience to a higher cause, as intrinsic belief is even more powerful than blind obedience. While most balisses are fundamentally honest, they use their guardian angel ability to seem less intimidating and decrease the chance the mortal will simply acquiesce to the opinion of an obviously divine being. Balisses often form from souls of those who performed evil acts but were redeemed. Many serve the goddess Sarenrae, but they can serve other good deities and empyreal lords as well.",Angel,8
Ball Python,"This nonvenomous snake’s name comes from its tendency to curl into a ball when frightened, though most people know it for its hunting tactic of coiling around prey and crushing victims with its powerful muscles. Nonetheless, brave herpetologists sometimes keep ball pythons as pets.",Snake,1
Balor,"When folk whisper frightened tales of the demonic, what most envision is the balor—a towering figure of fire and flesh, a horned nightmare armed with a flaming whip and a sword flying through the night in search of its latest victim. On the Abyss, balors serve demon lords as generals or captains, and they typically command vast legions of demons. Standing at 14 feet in height, only the cruelest mortal souls—those who devoted entire lives to sins too numerous to count—can fuel the formation of a balor. More often, a balor forms from a mass of dozens of mortal souls who shared debased ideologies in life. Balor Lords Those rare few balors who form from single souls are the ones most likely to eventually transcend the notable power they already wield, becoming a nascent demon lord. These balor lords are each unique creatures of 21st to 25th level in power who rule their own realm in the Abyss. In time, a balor lord can further develop into a unique creature with wildly different powers, even ascending to the role of a true demon lord.",Demon,20
Bandit,"By setting ambushes and traps in concealing countryside, such as forests and mountains, bandits waylay travelers and plunder their valuables before disappearing back to their wilderness hideouts. Many bandits seek only to steal and release their victims alive, though a few prefer to leave no witnesses.",Criminals,2
Banshee,"Banshees are the furious, tormented souls of elves bound to the Material Plane by a betrayal that defined the final hours of their lives. Some banshees arise from elves who were slain by trusted friends and allies, or whose loved ones betrayed them on their deathbeds. Others spawn from elves whose treacherous deeds shortly before their deaths left a stain upon their souls. Regardless of their origin, banshees despise the living. This hatred of life is all too often a horrific inversion of their personalities in life. Some speculate that the more kind-hearted the elf (and the more wrenching the betrayal), the crueler the banshee. Banshees rarely stray far from where they perished and typically haunt thick forests and canopied swamps where little light graces the ground. Many banshees can be found in the elven nation of Kyonin, specifically in Tanglebriar, the sinister domain of the demon Treerazer. Similarly, a large number of banshees can be found lurking about the edges of drow settlements in the Darklands, as plenty of cruelty and betrayal exists in drow culture. Banshees’ mere touch inflicts pain and primal fear, and those exposed to their wails of grief rarely survive the experience.",,17
Baobhan Sith,"Undeath is rare in the fey realm of the First World, for that plane's infusion with the raw power of life makes undead uncomfortable at best. Yet a few fey have adopted the vile practices and habits of notorious undead while still being living themselves, as seen in the blood-drinking habits of the murderous baobhan sith.A baobhan sith avoids confrontations when outnumbered, and although territorial, they won't reveal their true nature to larger groups. They prefer to drink blood from victims they find attractive, and they avoid drinking blood from animals and beasts entirely, as they consider such activities to be uncultured.",,6
Baomal,"Few sea monsters are as dreaded and feared as the two-headed baomal. These massive predatory beasts typically dwell in the deepest waters and compete with krakens and other monsters for food. They feed on whales and other large sea creatures, sometimes following them to the water’s surface. Near the surface, baomals that encounter ships quickly learn that they contain a variety of tasty morsels. The creatures use their devastating spikes to rip open the ships’ hulls, then leisurely feed on the helpless sailors.",,20
Barbazu,"Barbazus, known also as bearded devils or infantry devils, are murderous fiends who satiate their lust for annihilation by serving as the foot soldiers of Hell’s armies, often leading hordes of lesser devils such as imps and lemures into battle. Bearded devils wield serrated glaives to inflict jagged gashes that resist healing magic, resulting in tremendous blood loss. When enemies come too close, bearded devils strike with the spines of their wriggling beards to deliver a wretched contagion called Avernal fever, savoring the sight of their victim’s strength being slowly devoured from within. Barbazus can be found savagely indulging the whims of evil infernal lords from all layers of Hell, rejoicing as they disseminate murder, misery, and anguish as they see fit.",Devil,5
Barghest,"Typical barghests are ravenous gluttons of life who feed and grow on the fat of mortals, their bodies changing in ways none can predict as they use the flesh and blood of their victims to achieve grisly transformations into greater barghests. Barghests often make use of their shapechanging abilities to rule tribes of goblinoids or to discreetly hunt in rural areas in the guise of unnaturally intelligent wolves. They do not work well together, as each barghest wants all the kills for itself; cannibalism is the typical result of too many barghests in one small area.",Barghest,4
Barkeep,"Barkeeps are often friends and mentors within a community, lending an ear while supplying libations. The best barkeeps have some talent for storytelling and passing on valuable advice.",Publicans,1
Barnacle Ghoul,"Far more powerful and dangerous than most ghouls, barnacle ghouls are the risen corpses of veteran sailors who fell overboard or of bloodthirsty pirates who died from keelhauling. Too rugged and hate-filled to stay dead, these seafarers return with bluish, water-bloated bodies. Barnacle ghouls have a supernatural command over barnacles; a simple touch from a ghoul causes the crustaceans to adhere, grow, or release. The ghouls cultivate clusters of barnacles on their hands and feet, using the lumpy shells to more easily climb and grab at prey. Barnacle ghouls keep their lungs filled with brackish seawater, which they exhale onto their victims. Breathing in even a few drops of this tainted seawater can be deadly, as it magically expands in a victim's lungs. A creature that can't expel the seawater eventually drowns and rises as a new barnacle ghoul. Barnacle ghouls have many abilities of standard ghouls.",Ghoul,9
Barrister,"Barristers may serve as criminal prosecutors or as legal advocates, defending the rights of those accused of crimes or named as defendants in civil cases. In a court case or other legal proceeding, the barrister is a 4th-level challenge.",Officers,-1
Basidirond,"The basidirond, also called a mindfrond, is a fungal creature that crawls about on woody tendrils. The large, bowl-shaped pod atop its body collects mineral-rich moisture—-whether runoff from cave walls or fresh blood—-for sustenance. It uses hallucinogenic spores to incapacitate prey long enough for it to beat its prey to a bloody pulp, then deposits the deliciously tenderized remains into this pod for consumption. A basidirond is over 6 feet tall and 3 to 4 feet wide, and weighs nearly 300 pounds when saturated.",,5
Basilisk,"The basilisk is an eight-legged reptile with a nasty disposition and the ability to turn creatures to stone with its gaze. Folklore holds that, much like for the cockatrice, the first basilisks hatched from leathery eggs laid by snakes and incubated by roosters, but little in the basilisk’s physiology lends any credence to this claim. A basilisk prefers to eat petrified flesh. Once a victim has been turned to stone, the basilisk crunches the fossilized corpse with its powerful jaws and lets its potent stomach acids do the rest. This digestive process is extremely slow and inefficient, causing the basilisk to move so lethargically that it appears as if in mid-petrification itself. This has even led to the saying “as slow as a well-fed basilisk.” Certainly basilisks are well-known for their slow gait and slothful nature, but a predator that can turn its prey to stone with a glance hardly has much need for speed. An adult basilisk is 13 feet long from head to tail and weighs roughly 300 pounds. These reptiles make hissing sounds when moving about that turns to a guttural gurgle when they’re agitated. Though they are normally solitary creatures that come together only to mate and lay eggs, there are periodic reports of regions being infested with unusual numbers of basilisks. What causes these unusual congregations of basilisk activity is unknown. For unknown reasons, weasels and ferrets are immune to the basilisk’s stare, and they sometimes sneak into basilisk lairs while a parent is hunting in order to consume eggs or freshly hatched young. Some legends suggest that a basilisk’s blood can transmute common stones into other material, but this is likely a case of witnesses misinterpreting the magical restoration of previously petrified creatures or body parts.",Basilisk,5
Bastion Archon,"The mightiest of archon-kind form in the heat of battle from incredibly uncommon circumstances. When a gathering of lantern archons converges into a gestalt in order to defend allies in a fight that seems all but lost, a fellow archon of significant strength—such as a star archon—can commit a brave act of self-sacrifice by dimensionally transposing itself with the gestalt. If the circumstances are just right and luck is with the archons, the result is not a glorious sacrifice, but instead the earth-rocking emergence of a bastion archon. In this way, the lowliest of archons—the lanterns—can, in an instant, become their kind's greatest hope.Bastion archons are massive beings made of the very stone of Heaven's Holy Mountain, with their visages obscured by a blinding light surrounding the gestalt that originally formed the bastion. Tireless in their embodiment of the virtue of sacrifice, a bastion archon almost always protects the area where they manifested, and even when they are destroyed they leave an indelible mark of righteousness upon the surrounding region.",Archon,20
Bauble Beast,"The reclusive and deceptive creatures called bauble beasts create false jewelry as a byproduct of their extremely bizarre magical digestive systems. Two natural skin conditions provide the raw materials for this process: scaly patches of thin layers of metal, and warts that resemble gemstones. By chewing loose these patches and swallowing them, a bauble beast magically constructs the jewelry in its guts. After passing the forgery, it polishes and reshapes the item to make it more convincing. The beast then sneaks into a settlement to place the jewelry somewhere it can be found. A creature who dons this false jewelry is compelled to fetch their real valuables and deliver them to the beast, which it happily collects. Some bauble beasts simply send the confused victim on their way, but other more evil bauble beasts slay them to avoid being found out. This imitation jewelry fools laypeople, but it's infamous among merchants. Merchant training usually includes a brief course on detecting bauble beast jewelry's subtle but distinctive sweet odor. Though largely solitary, bauble beasts occasionally socialize with others who share their limited interests, primarily merchants, jewelers, earth elementals, and other bauble beasts. Xorns have a particular fondness for bauble beasts—or at least their gems. Though these aren't as nourishing as real gems, xorns find the flavor decadent and eat them as a sort of junk food.",,6
Baykok,"A baykok is the restless remnant of a warrior or hunter, cast out for evil acts and cursed to forever soar through the sky far from its home, unable to ever set foot on the ground again. The creature's despairing, lonely cries at night are audible for miles across the wilderness it haunts. Jealous rage drives it to hunt isolated humanoids, especially warriors and hunters who remind it of the life it once had and squandered. A baykok's invisible arrows carry its soul-freezing loneliness, and its envious touch can steal a helpless victim's vitality.",,9

Bebilith,"While demons control much of the Abyss, even they are hunted in the wilder regions of this horrific plane. The most notorious of these predators—though not the deadliest—is the bebilith. These fiends resemble elephant-sized spiders with glowing eyes, barbed chitin, and a fanged maw dripping caustic fluid.Many demons and planar travelers have underestimated bebiliths' devious intellects, believing them to be little more than oversized vermin. Bebiliths take advantage of this, ambushing foes with unexpected tactics. While they lash out at any creatures they encounter, they take great pleasure in chewing on demonic flesh. Qlippoth are the only creatures bebiliths never consume.",,10

Beggar,"Wherever there is poverty, there are beggars. Beggars are truly the downtrodden of society—folks who have been cast out into the streets due to a variety of setbacks or the weight of circumstance. Some beggars work for underworld organizations as lookouts, spies, or even hired muscle on the cheap—sometimes by choice, but often not.",Downtrodden,-1

Belker,"These reclusive elementals have glowing red eyes, leathery wings, and long, sharp claws. While they always retain their shape, belkers can control the solidity of their forms at will, transforming into clouds of smoke, ash, and dust.","Elemental, Air",6
Berberoka,"Berberokas are giant humanoids who live among forests and swamps, where they use their ability to swallow massive amounts of water to drain small ponds and lakes. Creatures who visit their favorite watering hole and find only an empty mud basin become prey for the berberoka, who hides in the brush and overwhelm their prey with a massive torrent of regurgitated water. A berberoka's mottled backside—which resembles a bundle of local plants, small trees, and large rocks—grants them natural camouflage that allows them to hide in plain sight. Berberokas tend to disguise themselves as rock formations in the center of a dried-up waterbed while they lie in wait for passersby. In the tropical regions where berberokas are most common, locals know to give empty ponds a wide berth, regardless of the enticing fish flopping about. Hungry travelers, on the other hand, might see such bounty as a blessing from the gods, only to be swept up in the berberoka's deadly deluge.",,15
Betobeto-San,"A betobeto-san wanders the highways and byways of the Material Plane, searching for unwilling traveling companions to sustain the spirit's appetite for fear. Though this shadow spirit is invisible in darkness or shade, in light they appear as a formless, shadowy mass with two sandaled feet. These sandals are made of wood or bone that cause the creature's footsteps to make the distinct “beto beto” sound from which they receive their name. A wide, toothy mouth smiles in the middle of their otherwise featureless mass, and they can manifest long, clawed limbs. Betobeto-san trail behind nighttime travelers, compelled to follow until the creatures verbally offer to let the betobeto-san pass. This compulsion isn't usually malicious by nature and occurs more from a betobeto-san's misguided desire for company and courtesy; unfortunately, they lack of understanding how this behavior can frighten others. Betobeto-san don't attack those they follow, but they often end up in combat because their unwelcome behavior causes those they follow to attack first.",,12
Bhanyada Behemoth,"The largest bhanyadas are made up of tens of thousands of component parts, all mashed together into a roughly humanoid shape that walks on stumpy legs. Bhanyada behemoths usually have at least four thick arms ending in meaty fists, although some behemoths have a profusion of hands sprouting from their torsos. A bhanyada behemoth's head is studded with tiny eyes all over its surface that observe the surrounding terrain and give information so the entire amalgamation can move in unison.",Bhanyada,12
Bhanyada Scavenger,"Not much larger than dogs, the typical bhanyada scavenger is a warty, misshapen tangle of flesh that walks on stumpy legs, sometimes on two and sometimes on four. Plainly amalgamations of meat and gristle, few of which appear in the same color or texture, bhanyada scavengers have a horrifying mottled appearance. Their bulbous heads split into a maw with blunt teeth that shift about within their mouths to grind food. Bhanyada scavengers prefer living prey and usually hunt in numbers, often following in the wake of bhanyada behemoths to snatch up any scraps left behind.",Bhanyada,8
Bhanyada Swarm,Bhanyadas without much cohesion between their fleshy components roil around one another in a ghastly swarm of malodorous gobs of flesh.,Bhanyada,11
Bhuta,"When sapient creatures die violently in a natural setting or a location infused with primal magic, they sometimes rise as a ghostlike undead called a bhuta. Resembling a translucent version of their mortal form, only shadowless and with backward feet, a bhuta's lust for vengeance or unquenchable desire to complete an unfinished task poisons the natural world, turning animals into agents of the bhuta's corrupted will. However, a bhuta's connection to their mortal life is weak and vague, more a series of compulsions and triggers than the torturous recollections of a ghost. Thus, while a bhuta might start by hunting down and devouring those who slew their mortal form, they find no relief and soon turn to predation through their domain.",,11
Bida,"Bidas are black-scaled dragons with long, serpentine bodies and bat-like wings. Their legs and claws are smaller than those of most dragons, but their powerful undulating coils, like those of a boa constrictor, are potent weapons capable of squeezing the life from several unfortunate victims at a time. A bida uses its impressive intellect and powerful magic to pose as a humanoid and infiltrate a settlement. Over the course of weeks or months, it establishes itself as a key member of the village, and only after it has become invaluable to the community does it reveal the terrible price of its assistance: regular offerings of flesh and gold. From this point on, the bida dwells almost exclusively within its smoggy lair, growing fat off the blood of its sacrificial offerings. To hide its presence from the outside world, a bida conceals its enslaved settlement in a large-scale illusion, leaving only a stand of jungle trees where once a thriving village may have been and ordering the townsfolk to destroy any roads in and out of town. Bidas begrudgingly tolerate others of their kind, instead preferring the company of their small, tasty thralls. In rare cases, a pair of bidas may join forces to conquer a particularly large settlement, extracting that much more wealth (and blood) from the populace as a result of their partnership.",,8
Binumir,"Whenever two individuals who share a strong emotional bond perish together, they might rise as a combined spirit known as a binumir. The two individuals' souls partially merge into a singular entity, though each one feels a constant longing for the other. This curse causes a binumir great distress and envy, leading the creature to lash out and attack others. Only the destruction of the binumir will liberate the two spirits and finally give them peace. Binumirs commonly appear in places where people die sharing their last moments together, such as in settlements hit by natural disasters. The two spirits of a binumir are distinct. Each half retains the visage of the respective individual that died to later form part of the creature. The spirits typically appear holding hands, but they constantly search for each other. They cry and weep for their lost loved one, unable to recognize the other's presence right beside them.",,3
Bison,"Bison are large bovines with short faces and two horns; they weigh an upwards of 2,000 pounds and stand up to 6 feet at the withers. Bison herds thunder across the grassy plains of Golarion, shaking the earth. They're a common sight along the Whistling Plains east of Taldor and the wide grasslands of the nation of Karazh in Casmaron; they also frequently appear in the cooler northeastern reaches of Avistan, the River Kingdoms through Numeria, and the Realm of the Mammoth Lords and western Sarkoris. Communal by nature, bison gather in large numbers for the summer mating season before the bulls split off to wander the prairie grasses. Bison have adapted well to harsh prairie winters, as their shaggy fur, which grows thicker in winter, insulates them; in the face of blizzards, they survive by facing steadfastly into the howling winds and hunkering down to reduce their exposure. The way that bison wallow in dirt or rub against large stones might make it easy to mistake their docile nature for passivity. However, this presumption has been the ruin of many hunting parties. Their plentiful meat and thick furs make bison an appealing bounty, but with the ground thundering beneath them, bison can quickly overpower inexperienced hunters unprepared for a stampeding herd. These hunting parties sometimes hire particularly daring adventures, who can add their spells, steel, and expertise to ensure a successful hunt. While the bison of the plains are the best known and most numerous, they have cousins both in thick boreal forests and along wide, open steppes. These bison variants stand taller but can't match the speed and aggression of their smaller plains relatives.",,4
Black Bear,"Contrary to the name, black bears can be cinnamon or even blond in coloration, depending on which hue is most beneficial for surviving in their local environment. Regardless of their coloration, they are opportunistic eaters who gain sustenance from berries and nuts just as often as from fish and smaller mammals. They steal food when they find it, including from humanoid camps. Although they are predators, black bears are more timid than other bears. Unless defending themselves or their young, black bears often avoid conflict or fight only until they can retreat.",Bear,2
Black Pudding,"Most often found below ground, these oozes scour caves for objects to dissolve with their corrosive secretions. This caustic acid is particularly dangerous to creatures that attack a pudding, as it can quickly damage and destroy gear.",Ooze,7
Black Scorpion,"With a carapace the color of polished obsidian and a penchant for attacking villages, this humongous scorpion is one of the desert's most frightening predators. A black scorpion measures 60 feet from tip to the base of its stinger.",Scorpion,15
Blackfrost Prophet,"With their hulking physiques and the potent connection to the Crown of the World, saumen kar who succumb to blackfrost become especially dangerous blackfrost dead. Those who guarded the Temple of Aqakaru in life continue to do so in undeath, albeit even more vigilantly and much more violently. Blackfrost prophets, as these wardens are sometimes known, maintain their formidable intellect and innate connection to their boreal environment, though the curse of blackfrost has stripped them of their memories and filled their hearts with evil.",Blackfrost Dead,9
Blackfrost Zombie,"Most creatures who perish from the cold while cursed with blackfrost rise as zombies. Though mindless, blackfrost zombies are driven by the invisible will of blackfrost to spread their foul curse.",Blackfrost Dead,6
Blindheim,"Inhabitants of damp, subterranean caves, blindheims resemble stubby humanoids with oversized, frog-like heads and bulbous eyes. Their eyes emit a soft glow at all times, but a blindheim can draw back the heavy membrane that normally covers them to emit an intense light as bright as day. These simple creatures use their lights to draw in or disorient prey, mostly small animals like lizards, rodents, or fish. However, they might go after larger prey if trying to feed their young. When they encounter creatures their own size or larger they retreat, flashing their eyes to facilitate their escape if necessary. They often hunt in pairs or small packs. Using their lights to coordinate from a distance, they slowly close in on the creatures they hunt. One common hunting pattern involves one blindheim diving deep and using its light to chase fish to the surface, while another up above snatches them up and tosses them onto the land to eat later.Blindheims make their nests in damp caverns, especially grottoes next to underground lakes or bogs. An ideal nest rests in a cozy cavern with plenty of fungus to eat, a few fish swimming in a lake, and the comforting drip of water from the ceiling. Blindheims prefer to lead quiet and serene lives, and even when first born they emit only the meekest of vocalizations. A blindheim is born shining, and its parents cuddle over it to dim the light so as to avoid attracting predators.It's not just animals that endanger blindheims. Underground peoples find the creatures useful and attempt to capture them for specialized purposes. Duergars use them as “raid frogs,” placing heavy hoods over blindheims' heads and revealing them suddenly during raids to blind their foes. They sometimes send the creatures along with their slaves that lack darkvision into the mines as a source of light. Drow use them for some of these same purposes, and some nobles have been known to treat the creatures as mere lanterns, having them hoisted to the ceilings of their halls. Neither duergars nor drow take good care of the captive creatures, so blindheims rarely last long in captivity.",,2
Blink Dog,"At first glance, blink dogs seem to be little more than long-eared, bearded canines with tawny coats. Yet their intelligent eyes and the blue nimbus of energy that dances across their fur hint at not only the blink dog's inherent intelligence, but also of their connection to the occult energies and mysteries that hide beyond the sight of the untrained eye. These honorable creatures are as intelligent as most humanoids. They live and hunt in large packs, roaming forests, plains, and the hidden places of the world in hunt for evil creatures—particularly those that dwell in the depths of the Ethereal Plane.Unless acting in concert with specific allies who have proven that their goals are shared, blink dogs tend to avoid other creatures if at all possible. Their packs are constantly on the move and hidden from those that would seek them out. But in times of need, they have been known to come to the rescue of villages and lost travelers. While they have no innate ability to travel to the Ethereal Plane for extended periods of time, all blink dogs constantly shimmer and ripple between the Material Plane and the Ethereal. They do their best to use their ability to blink to snatch glimpses into the Ethereal Plane and keep track of potential threats that might be building there, but in practice this tactic yields more of a constant stream of hunches and estimations of Ethereal-based threats. Of course, to a blink dog, this constant state of flux is as natural as breathing.Pack leadership always falls to a pair—an elder blink dog (called an alpha) who relies upon the valued guidance of a trusted pack mate (the sage). Honor and tradition are keystones of blink dog society. They are fiercely loyal, defending the pack or creatures they befriend to the death and maintaining oaths handed down from litter to litter. Though different packs hold different traditions and oaths, their connection through the tales and stories told among their kind and the shared experience of the movement of stars above weave all blink dogs into an extended family, a great pack. Through their myths and folklore, blink dogs have names for celestial phenomena, note births under auspicious stars, and read omens from unusual stellar conjunctions. These celestial signs are woven into blink dogs' lifeways; their names contain a reference to the specific constellation under which they were born, and a pack's sage watches the heavens for signs to help them decide when a pup is old enough for their first hunt.",,2
Blizzardborn,"Freezing and thawing in a near-constant loop, blizzardborn resemble humanoid forms composed of a mixture of partially melted snow and sleet. These elementals move with crunching strides, their bodies constantly sloshing and sloughing off shards of ice. Because of their ability to refreeze, blizzardborn can travel into warmer environments safely, though they tend to look more like slush in these areas.","Elemental, Water",6
Blodeuwedd,"The mysterious blodeuwedds dwell in those parts of the world where the boundaries between the Material Plane and the First World have worn thin, or around portals between the two planes. Their link with such regions of the natural world is so strong that it rivals the bond shared between nymphs and places of great natural beauty, yet none would look upon a blodeuwedd and mistake them for something as elegant as a nymph.Although blodeuwedds share certain traits with nymphs, their role as guardians of the pathways between this world and the First World prevents them from forming as powerful a magical bond with the natural world. Never truly a part of either reality yet forced to keep watch over both, blodeuwedds tend to grow cynical and sharp-tongued toward any who would seek travel from one realm to the other, regardless of their actual goals.",,6
Blood Boar,"Blood boars are fearsome swine bred in Cheliax for the singular purpose of hunting down escaped slaves. The species originated from a type of large feral boar native to Nidal’s shadowy Uskwood, and blood boars retain their predecessors’ gray fur, red eyes, and exceptional senses. The intensive breeding process to produce blood boars—augmented by the selective application of magic—grants the creatures an unparalleled awareness of blood, including the ability to precisely detect a bloodied creature’s location and movements, allowing the boars to track their prey from up to a mile away. Blood boars’ keepers groom and mark the animals to enhance their already unsettling appearance. While from a distance, a blood boar might be mistaken for an ordinary pig, up close the differences are stark. Blood-red eyes, ashen fur, and unnaturally sharp tusks frame hundreds of pounds of raw muscle, the veins of which can be seen through the boar’s ghastly pale flesh. Chains, manacles, and spikes are typical blood boar accessories, ensuring the boars are as fearsome as possible. A blood boar’s ability to track its quarry using only the scent of the target’s blood has been the bane of many thieves, brigands, and the occasional illicit lover, but none have as much cause to fear the beasts as slaves in pursuit of freedom. Even washing off spilled blood does nothing to deter the blood boar’s pursuit if it already has the scent. As a result, many halflings in the Bellflower Network zealously practice disarming and nonlethal combat techniques specifically to avoid accidental bloodshed during an escape.",,6
Blood Hag,"Blood hags, also known as soucouyants, infiltrate communities in the guise of young, innocent humanoids. This disguise is more than an illusion, for a blood hag wears the skin of a previous victim to hide her true appearance. During the day, her disguise is almost perfect, especially if the community knows nothing about the person the hag is pretending to be. But after sunset, the creature sheds her skin, hides it in a safe place, and stalks the night to drink the blood that sustains her. Able to travel quickly in the form of a ball of fire and to slip through keyholes or the slightest crack in a door or window, blood hags feed on sleeping victims then return home before morning to don their stolen skin.",Hag,8
Blood Painter,"Simultaneously enamored with the natural world yet too alien to survive in it, blood painters are eight-limbed artists who stalk, kill, and dismember in search of pigment and sustenance alike. Blood painter physiology can't digest typical food, so the creatures feed by harvesting blood and using it to paint and animate something edible. When not on the hunt, blood painters seek out beautiful vistas, which they placidly admire via the eyes in the hands of their uppermost limbs and then reproduce on canvas. Exceptional art endlessly fascinates these creatures, and skilled dancers and painters alike occasionally escape the aberrations by creating a new work to trade for their lives. Blood painters jealously guard these works, and much of their treasure consists of art. Blood painters tend to mastermind the periodic theft of masterpieces.",,9
Bloodseeker,"Scourges of swamps and damp, abandoned places, bloodseekers are ravenous blood drinkers. Farmers curse the creatures for sucking their livestock dry. It is from such beleaguered people that the bloodseeker's regional name “stirge,” possibly a corruption of the word “scourge,” comes. Folk wisdom holds that the appearance of bloodseekers in a region signals a healthy herd of livestock, but more often it means bogs or old buildings that haven't been properly tended to. Certainly, no amount of folksy parable can assuage a farmer driven to destitution by a bloodseeker infestation. But despite their role as parasites, bloodseekers aren't hated by all villages. In some cases, the inhabitants of remote backwoods thorps even keep the things as pets or use them as doubtful medicinal “tools” to drain away unwanted humors or test for evil spirits possessing the blood. Worshippers of gods of pestilence and parasites often view bloodseekers as sacred to their faith and allow the creatures to feed freely from their bodies. In such societies, those who accidentally give too much are considered to have been “blessed” by the village's hungry god. Bloodseekers seem to be constantly hungry, but they are not inherently malevolent. They can be scared away fairly easily and prefer to swiftly retreat rather than risk death. Some adventurers report that these creatures can be scared away by waving torches at the flying pests. However, bloodseekers are much bolder when encountered in larger numbers, as bringing down one victim lets an entire colony feed. Bloodseeker colonies are called clots, for obvious and disgusting reasons. If a lone bloodseeker finds a likely victim while its clot is nearby, it emits a high-pitched, keening noise to summon reinforcements. Most humanoids avoid bloodseekers, but boggards sometimes cultivate bloodseeker nests around the perimeter of their territory. These colonies serve as a deterrent to intruders, and the boggards sometimes check for bloodseeker prey, collecting the hides or bodies of animals killed by the pests. Meals prepared from slain bloodseekers that have gorged on the blood of specific creatures are a staple among certain boggard communities. The boggards not only eat the actual bloodseekers, but they also make a gelled slurry from the drained blood. A typical bloodseeker is about a foot long, with mottled, reddish-brown skin and a yellow underbelly. Its four wings resemble bat wings. When gorged with blood, the creature becomes bloated and pink, and it tends to wobble unsteadily in the air as it flies off to digest its meal.",,-1
Bloodshroud,"During the war between Geb and Nex, necromancers conducted dangerous magical experiments to gain every possible advantage over their enemies. One such endeavor attempted to distill the essence of vampiric mists to create a protective shroud for an army of undead maguses.",,13
Blue-Ringed Octopus,"While relatively small, the blue-ringed octopus is particularly venomous for its size.",Octopus,0
Blustering Gale,"Blustering gales are among the least of air elementals: spirits of the small breezes who sometimes arise in the wake of mightier creatures, like the downdraft of a swallow's wing or the sharp expulsion of a vigorous cough. Unwilling or unable to act effectively alone, they form into “gales,” collections of weak elementals that use their combined power to hurl insults and pummel those who defy them in a misguided attempt to rise above their humble origins. Together, they force other creatures to do their bidding, then move on when they grow bored. While most gales claim their abandoned minions were useless, in truth, blustering gales lack the commanding presence and confidence to retain vassals for long.",,11
Boar,"Boars are omnivorous mammals, hunted heavily because their meat is considered a delicacy. Boars are most likely to attack humanoids either in self-defense or during their mating season in the winter months, when the males grow an extra inch of tissue to protect their organs as they fight off rivals. Of course, in some cultures boars are trained to become much more aggressive so they can fill the roles of warbeast and guardian. When such boars escape back into the wild, they can become true terrors of the region.",Boar,2
Bodak,"When a living, sentient humanoid is exposed to an extreme expression of supernatural evil, the experience can irrevocably damn the victim, crushing their mind and ripping out their soul in an appalling, unholy transformation that results in a creature that's anathema to life—the bodak.The shreds of physicality that survive this absolute corruption serve only to enhance the humanoid's profoundly disturbing appearance. The bodak's body is horrifically twisted, as though it's locked in a convulsion of agony and terror. Its desiccated and hairless flesh bears an otherworldly, pearlescent sheen, strung taut across a malformed skeleton that reduces its gait to a slow shamble. But most disturbing of all are its eyes, set in a drooping, melted visage with scant remains of its former facial structure. These eyes, sunken deep into their sockets, nevertheless glow with an unholy light, stare with unremitting malevolence, and constantly weep noxious vapor.Fragmented memories of a prior existence filtered through a vengeful hatred of the living lead the bodak to try to return to those places it once knew. If successful, it assaults former friends, acquaintances, and loved ones with its murderous gaze and an incomprehensible torrent of gibberish laced with vile curses, accusations, and threats—an assault that often leads to the victims rising as newly formed bodaks themselves.",,8
Bodyguard,"Hired to protect someone famous or powerful, bodyguards use intimidation, quick wits, and martial skill to keep their charges safe. Such mercenaries might be auxiliaries to a noble's own guards, but with special directives to safeguard their patrons.",Mercenaries,1
Bog Mummy,"The cultural practice of mummifying the dead is not the only way a body can become preserved, nor is it the only route that gives rise to these disease-spreading undead monstrosities. Bog mummies (also called peat mummies or mire mummies) rarely, if ever, leave their marshy realms. Less powerful than their more notorious artificially preserved kin, bog mummies are preserved not by agents introduced during rituals but by the natural elements present in the airless, acidic morass of a peat bog or muddy swamp. While corpses preserved in this manner can certainly rise from the mire as bog mummies as the result of a curse by fell powers or the directed influence of a necromancer, the vast majority of them animate from a seething need for vengeance or to pursue some dire agenda left unfinished at the time of death—often because the creature was slain or otherwise betrayed. The nature of this emotional tie to life and the emotional power of the deceased compel unlife beyond death, while the preservative qualities of the bog within which the body was disposed of does the rest. Although most bog mummies are motivated by vengeance, many fulfill their dark yearnings with general violence. Filled with wrath and hatred for the living, they mercilessly attack any living creatures that dare to venture into their dismal domains. Their agonized moans echo over their putrid homes, driving away most natural life dwelling therein and often alerting travelers to the potential danger that lies beneath the surface.",Mummy,5
Bog Strider,"The insectile bog striders call themselves seshes, but they take no offense at those who use the more common vernacular to refer to them. They resemble upright water striders with four legs, two arms, and powerful mandibles. Bog striders can move about on water like solid ground, chasing down prey or fleeing from predators across the water. They rarely leave the swampy rivers and lakes they call home. Bog striders stand 5 feet tall and weigh approximately 150 pounds. A bog strider's diet consists almost entirely of meat, but they prefer to feed only on animals, as they consider the consumption of the flesh of any sapient creature a taboo.In sesh society, each individual is expected to serve equally in all efforts to ensure the society's survival against the more aggressive creatures often found in or near their swampland homes. In addition, each member of the community is expected to develop a skill that contributes to the community's prosperity, and by extension, the continued survival of the species. Traditionally, female bog striders are builders and artisans while males are hunters and gatherers, but often such roles aren't limited to a single gender, as every member of a small community pitches in to help as they can.",,2
Bogey,"A bogey typically hunts a single creature at a time, usually a small child or elderly person, methodically stalking and tormenting their prey. Often hiding under a bed, amid a dark attic space, or in a closet left slightly ajar, the bogey delights in the slow, methodical cultivation of fear in its victims.",Bogeyman,3
Bogeyman,"These nocturnal stalkers tail their chosen quarry for days, even weeks at a time, ominously showing up in back alleys, shadowy street corners, and even in victims’ own homes before going in for the kill. For unfathomable reasons, a bogeyman may spare a victim’s life and instead kidnap them, absconding to a far-off location before returning years later with a fresh bogey in tow.",Bogeyman,10

Boiling Spring,"Often mistaken for air elementals due to their hazy, almost-imperceptible forms, a boiling spring is a humanoid water elemental made of scalding steam and bubbling water. When summoned to the Universe, a boiling spring raises the ambient temperature around them, making the surrounding climate humid and muggy. They seem to enjoy the discomfort they cause, though some regard it as merely a fun prank while others truly revel in the misery and look for ways to cause more.","Elemental, Water",13
Bone Croupier,"For many, gambling is just fun and games, but for some, it can become a bad habit or even a life-consuming addiction. Bone croupiers take the meaning of “life-consuming” to its literal extreme. These gamblers' lust for cards and dice couldn't be sated in life, so in undeath they haunt the shadowy corners of gambling halls and continue their search for that next hit of adrenaline. For bone croupiers, gaming takes on a different flavor; with nothing left to lose, these undead turn their attentions toward others, cajoling and palavering normally casual gamers into committing themselves to ever-higher stakes. Before they know it, these unsuspecting victims have called in decadesold favors and put liens on their homes in the hope of winning back just a fraction of the pot. By then, the bone croupier has already claimed their prize—to this undead chiseler, any earnings are incidental, and the real prize is encouraging others to lose their own. Bone croupiers often enshroud themselves in thick layers of cigar smoke or voluminous robes to mask their undead nature, but they almost always wear wicked grins at the table. This smile is no ruse or part of their poker face, however—the truth is that bone croupiers truly delight in games, regardless of whether they win or lose, and despite their incredible skills of deception and trickery, most simply can't disguise their unbridled mirth.",,5
Bone Prophet,"The speakers for the dead known as bone prophets hold an esteemed place as voices for their decapitated god. Burial rites, necromantic rituals, and the delivery of cryptic utterances supposedly whispered to them by Ydersius all fall under the dominion of these priests. Bone prophets often raise fallen aapophs as skeletons.",Serpentfolk,8
Bone Ship,"Rarely does anything living remain after a bone ship's passing—only death, destruction, and waves red as blood that clash and foam in its wake. When a bone ship forms, necromantic magic dredges great bones from the seabed and slowly bends them into place with malicious intent. Whales' ribs typically form the timbers of the hull, and their great spinal columns twist into towering masts. Muscles and tendons lash the ship together, tightening and loosening to precisely turn the ship as it sails. When a bone ship encounters another vessel or finds some other opportunity to sow death, smaller corpses strewn throughout the ship animate to form a crew and boarding party. Each crew member resembles a humanoid skeleton, but they might be made of bones from multiple creatures. For battle, the ship also creates magical cannons formed of bone that propel bone shards and debris with blasts of magic. The small black gemstones stippled across the ship's structure hold the souls of a drowned crew, for a bone ship is the cursed legacy of dead sailors. When mass death happens at sea—often from an entire ship sinking far from shore—the anguish of the dying victims can spawn a bone ship. This event might occur when a sailor makes a final plea to a dark god or when a deity takes the opportunity to bind many dead sailors' souls together as a destructive show of divine power. When not created through divine intervention, a bone ship can grow slowly and organically from one of the ships piloted by the undead sailors known as draugr. As draugr ships plague the seas and sink other vessels, they can collect more souls and bones, eventually becoming bone ships. These vessels look different from many other bone ships with patchwork or asymmetrical appearances. A bone ship is almost gluttonous, possessing an unceasing appetite for death, destruction, and new souls to add to its number. These desires stem from an underlying cause, either placed within the ship by its creator or accreted from the scattered final wishes of its component dead souls. For example, a deity might send a bone ship on a special mission to carry a message or dispose of a particularly persistent adversary or annoyance. Though bone ships usually travel upon the waves, they have no need to breathe and can carry out underwater missions at the behest of their creator. Bone ships hold a legendary reputation among sailors. These undead can appear out of nowhere to wreak destruction, and if a crew's bodies are absent from a shipwreck, the calamity might be blamed on a bone ship. The sea can bring death suddenly in many ways, but eternal enslavement of the soul presents a more terrifying fate than death alone.",,18

Bore Worm Swarm,"A single finger-length bore worm is unpleasant but mostly innocuous. Ten thousand bore worms, on the other hand, pose a formidable threat to even seasoned adventurers. The countless worms form a roiling, rancid mass of acid and pain, capable of delivering a hideous death to any person or beast unable to escape them. Unfortunately for any creature other than a bore worm, most encounters involve swarms.",Bore Worm,5

Bounty Hunter,"Bounty hunters are constantly on the move, whether within city walls or the wilderness, trailing their fugitive quarries for capture… or disposal. Often relying on stealth or deception as much as martial skill, bounty hunters employ a vast array of talents to accomplish their goals, not to mention to collect the hefty payout that follows.",Mercenaries,4
Brain Collector,"The grotesque brain collectors (or neh-thalggus, as they call themselves) originate from worlds far beyond the known solar system, and are part of a conglomeration of hostile aliens known collectively as the Dominion of the Black. Whether driven by their own schemes or directives from sinister overlords, brain collectors arrive in living starships to harvest the brains of intelligent creatures. These aberrations draw no nutrition from brains, instead storing them for analysis and as vessels for occult magical energies. A brain collector’s form evokes that of a tailless scorpion, but the pulsing brain-filled blisters that glisten along its back make them impossible to mistake for merely oversized arachnids. Baleful eyes glare from the joints on their legs, and the unsettling, intrusive whisper-thoughts they telepathically broadcast into the minds of those they seek to feed on can be interpreted as threats or promises alike. Brain collectors have very little empathy for the denizens of any world they visit, despite the fact that certain cults venerate them, or the Dominion they hail from, as if they were gods. To brain collectors, terrestrial creatures are simply resources for their magical needs and occult powers. They have little interest in worshipping gods or being worshipped themselves, yet they do practice strange forms of religion of their own, in which they consider the primordial forces of deep space as worthy of faith and fear.",,8
Brainchild,"A rumor can become so vivid and so persistent that it comes to life, creating a brainchild—a living illusion that hatches from an intense belief in a remorseless and implacable killer. Often, these rumors swirl around the victims of a phantasmal killer spell. A brainchild's capabilities grow when they pursue a believer but deflate against skeptics, making them only as bad as one thinks they are. A simple drive to stalk, terrify, and kill propels a brainchild, but the creature might also exhibit other behaviors ascribed to them through gossip.",,11
Bralani,"Bralanis embody the freedom of fair competition, embracing opportunities to test their skills against worthy foes and bring mortals together with the thrill of good-natured sports and contests. Their interest in constructive conflict also extends to higher stakes, such as diplomatic negotiations. In these cases, bralanis ensure that neither side's desires are crushed by the other's and work as mediators when needed. They believe in friendly contests to diffuse tension. When discussions are going well, bralanis step back, allowing the participants to shape their own futures. They delight in sailing through violent storms as wind, basking in the raw energy.",Azata,6
Brass Bastion,"Brass bastions are formidable sentinels crafted from elemental fire and extraplanar brass. While they can be shaped into many forms, most depict muscular warriors with curving horns and stern or taunting expressions. Within each brass shell is a raging inferno—the source of its ceaseless heat. Though ifrits originally created brass bastions to act as servants and guards, the knowledge of how to craft them has spread throughout the Plane of Fire. They can even be found on the Plane of Earth thanks to interplanar trade. In Medina Mudii'a, brass bastions walk the streets, tend shops, and stand guard. Bespoke brass bastions are passed down as family heirlooms or gifted to business partners and allies. Scions of the wealthiest ifrit lineages never travel without a train of brass bastions clad in family livery. Destroying a rival ifrit's brass bastion is a quick way to erode their political status, though anyone caught performing such sabotage faces swift retribution. Most brass bastions prominently display the sigil of their owner or maker, though magical methods can also determine who crafted a specific construct. Brass bastions forged by favored artisans are a status symbol in many ifrit communities. Ifrits consider a brass bastion crafted by a non-ifrit to be inherently inferior, barely worth the cost of its materials. Brass bastions obey magical programming imprinted at the time of their creation or follow commands from their owners. Most can't speak, but a few have magical voices and can parrot simple phrases, recite poetry, or tell bedtime stories at the crafter's fancy.",,14
Bregdi,"Bregdis hunt warm-blooded prey, lurking in the waters of most major port cities before using their ray-like bodies and hooked claws to hitch onto the underside of boats pulling into port. From beneath the docks and in the channels of settlements, bregdis wait for the careless or unlucky to fall into the water, where they make quick work of their hapless victims.Although bregdis have little more intelligence than most animals, a particularly opportunistic bregdi might realize that a fishing line often leads to a tasty meal. A bregdi that spots a fishing lure might grab it gently with its claw to imitate a fish caught on the line. Once a fisherman is “hooked” and starts to reel in, the bregdi plays along, slowly approaching the shore while making sluggish struggling motions. Once near land, the bregdi violently tugs on the lure to yank its unsuspecting prey into the water. Bregdis can survive out of water for short periods of time, but only the most desperate bregdis hunt on land.",,9
Bright Walker,"Those who encounter calignis quickly learn that their deaths involve burning out instead of bleeding out. At times, this dramatic immolation is denied to a caligni, so they arise as a bright walker. Tied to caligni society, these creatures don't understand that their glow damages and repels living calignis. Despite their name, these undead don't walk; they instead float a few inches above the ground.",,9
Brimorak,"These goat-headed demons have glowing red eyes and flaming hooves but measure only about 3 feet in height. Born from the souls of arsonists, the fiery brimoraks continue the work they pursued in life, as everything they touch quickly burns. As a general rule, brimoraks are ill-tempered even for demons, although their spite turns to glee in the face of a growing fire. Those who have survived encounters with these fiends report that they remember the braying sound of the brimoraks' laughter as clearly as the heat of the flames or the choking scent of smoke.",Demon,5
Brine Shark,Brine sharks are deadly elementals that roam the endless oceans of the Plane of Water.,"Elemental, Water",3
Brochmaw,"With bodies of fired clay, brochmaws look like walking cylindrical ovens split across the middle by their titular maws, which rage with the fires of culinary perfection. Behind their maw burns a powerful internal oven, where the elemental creatures roast their prey. Brochmaws are driven solely by their voracious appetites, only leaving their lairs to acquire new meals. Early attempts to force brochmaws into service resulted in their would-be captors being reduced to nothing more than ash on a plate, accompanied by a written review of how they tasted. Now, brochmaws are employed all across the Planes, lured by the sweet promise of new, fresh meat. Though brochmaws have no use for money, they do trade gifts for services. The only thing they have to offer is cooked meat from their own mouths, which they deem extremely valuable. Surprisingly, all who have tried brochmaw meat claim it to be a savory roasted delight. Given that brochmaws offer nothing but cooked meat and desire nothing but raw meat, trading with them is a simple if slightly dangerous affair, often coming down to the quantity and rarity of the meat offered. Brochmaws hate to see meat go to waste. If one discovers a carcass of any sort, they call others of their kind to join them in a festive cookout, with dancing and feasting inevitably accompanied by compliments or complaints about the quality of the food.",,13
Brontosaurus,"Brontosauruses are truly gigantic behemoths, plodding herbivores large enough to be unafraid of all but the most massive predators. Brontosauruses have stout bodies and long, sinuous necks ending in small heads, allowing them to graze from the highest treetops. Their powerful tails are equally as long as their necks and provide counterbalances. Brontosauruses bear their bulk upon four stout legs. Although their feet are capable of crushing entire buildings, these herbivores are generally peaceful and considerate of where they step. Most brontosauruses are dangerous only when defending themselves or their young, or when panicked enough to stampede. When roused in this way, however, the creatures are truly terrifying: their muscular tails sweep in great arcs and their massive feet crash down heedlessly onto the ground. A brontosaurus is 70 feet long and weighs more than 30 tons. Brontosauruses belong to a group of dinosaurs known as sauropods, all of which are immense in size. The brachiosaurus is among the tallest of these dinosaurs, and the diplodocus among the longest, but it’s likely that even larger behemoths exist.",Dinosaur,10
Brood Leech Swarm,"Most smaller species of leeches do not tend to swarm, but brood leeches are prone to gathering in seething, undulant mats of squirming gluttony. When they gather in sufficient numbers to swarm, they eschew the stealth of a lone leech's feeding methods in favor of swift and merciless feeding. In these situations, their mild venom can affect much larger creatures than their usual prey.",Leech,4
Brownie,"Brownies make their homes in the trunks of hollow trees, small earthy burrows, and even under porches or within the crawl spaces of farmhouses. Often attired in clothes that appear to be made of plants or leaves, brownies wear belts lined with pouches and tools. Whatever language they choose to speak is often is riddled with odd pronunciations and colloquialisms. Their manner of speaking might call upon turns of phrase that are decades or even centuries out of vogue, for example, or they might mix up their metaphors in strange ways. It almost seems as if brownies adopt these quirky ways of speaking intentionally—certainly they do not react favorably to corrections to their chatter. There's often no swifter way to annoy a brownie than to try to correct its grammar. Brownies stand barely 2 feet tall and weigh about 20 pounds.When facing danger, brownies rarely engage in combat, preferring instead to confound and confuse their attackers in order to buy enough time for escape. Content with honest toil and the love of their kin, brownies maintain a pacifist nature, harassing creatures only to run them off or punish them for an insult. Despite this nature, all brownies carry a blade. They refer to their swords with a hint of disgust, and jokingly call their blades their “final trick,” reserving their use for the direst of circumstances.Honest to a fault, brownies take freely but always repay their debt through work or leave something behind as an offering. They may eat an apple from a farmer's orchard but harvest the entire tree as repayment. A brownie might eat an entire pie left on a windowsill, only to straighten up the kitchen or wash the dishes. A brownie can share a home with a family for years and years while avoiding detection. A family that is aware of a brownie in their midst usually finds this a beneficial relationship and leaves dishes of milk, pieces of fruit, trinkets, and sometimes even wine as gifts. In exchange, the resident brownie keeps the home clean, mends clothes, repairs tools, and shoos away vermin and small predators. Bragging about having a brownie in the house is the best way to lose one. Brownies distrust foxes and fear wolves, and they avoid farms with dogs.",,1

Bugul Noz,"This gangly fey humanoid wanders the overgrown paths of dark, misty forests, voluntarily isolating themself in an attempt to protect others from their hideous form. A bugul noz’s appearance is not merely unsightly—to view the being’s form is said to tempt death, and backwoods villagers tell tales of wanderers found struck dead after merely glancing at the creature. As they jaunt through the forest, the bugul noz sings an eerie tune to alert others to their presence and deter these creatures from looking upon them. The bugul noz does not, after all, want to harm anyone; they are inherently kind, if unpredictable, and if they accidentally kill a creature out of panic or confusion, they grieve. A bugul noz who roams the same road long enough compiles a long list of such accidental victims, and they might carry the corpses off to a single mass grave deep in the forest. When not wandering, the bugul noz watches over this grave to ensure that the spirits of their victims are never lonely.",,12
Bul-Gae,"Bul-gaes are manifestations of the eclipsed sun and moon. They resemble large canines, though their coloration and features change as they exercise their powers over heat and cold. Depending on whether they have most recently unleashed their lunar or solar powers, a bul-gae resembles either a crimson hound wreathed in flames or a cerulean, frostbitten fox, respectively. Legends say that the first bul-gae attempted to steal the sun from the sky. As they bit down on the burning sphere, though, the bul-gae was badly burned. Having failed, they then tried to retrieve the moon, but when they touched the moon the bul-gae froze solid and fell to the ground. The descendants of that bul-gae forever hone their powers of flame and ice so that they may one day succeed where their ancestor failed.",,14
Bulette,"Bulettes are fearsome predators that roam just beneath the surface of desolate wilderness areas. When they burrow through the ground, only the fin of their thickly armored backs protrudes above—at least until they are ready to leap out and strike their prey. Their appearance, appetite, and iconic dorsal fin have earned the nickname “landshark.” A typical bulette claims a territory of approximately 500 square miles. When it finds an area rich in food, such as a farming village, it adds that area to its regular patrol route. Over the course of a few months, it can wipe entire settlements off the map. Bulettes are fiercely competitive creatures that battle relentlessly with other predators in their territory. They actively avoid contact or conflict with other members of their kind unless seeking a mate. Bulette pairs share territory and mate for life—a mated pair of bulettes being the only known exception to the creature’s penchant for solitude. They rear their young for a short period of time. The mated pair instruct the young bulette how to hunt, teaching their spawn which creatures are easiest to kill and which creatures to avoid. The mated pair drive off their young after its first successful hunt. The first bulettes were magically created guardians, intended to serve as frightening pets for a power-hungry and sadistic wizard. The technique for their creation, as well as their original purpose, has since been lost to history, and multiple conflicting accounts of ancient texts exist with dozens of wizards claiming to have been the first inventor of the notorious beast. Some sages postulate that the original inventor may have been an elf—a theory born out of little more than the curious fact that bulettes, for all their ravenous nature, seem to find elf flesh unpalatable. Unfortunately for elves who stumble into a bulette’s path, bulettes are no less likely to kill them than any other intruder, simply leaving the bodies unconsumed where they fall.",,8
Bunyip,"Bunyips are dangerous aquatic predators that resemble a cross between a shark and a seal. Found in freshwater inlets or saltwater coves worldwide, bunyips hunt where prey is plentiful, often to the consternation of coastal residents and fisherfolk. Despite their outlandish appearance and tendency to defend their territory with loud, bellowing roars that echo for great distances, bunyips are very rarely sighted by humanoids, leaving many to question their existence. For hundreds of years, bunyips were widely regarded as nothing more than folk tales, and even now that their existence as a species has been proven, the existence of any particular bunyip in a local area is often met with heavy skepticism. While their limited shapechanging abilities are no doubt a significant part of the reason for this air of mystery, another major factor is that the aquatic creatures rarely hunt humanoids, preferring to eat smaller animals. Most bunyips avoid human contact, except when one wanders too close to their den or favorite hunting spot, at which point the territorial bunyip attacks with swift and terrible ferocity. Many scholars agree that a large number of unexplained disappearances near coastal areas are the result of unreported bunyip aggression. In some ports, bunyips have learned that delicious prizes can be had from the chum and garbage discarded by fishing boats and merchant vessels. They lurk close to the shore and carefully choose their victims, plucking them off docks and small boats. These bunyips are particularly careful to keep their true forms hidden, but this does little to dull rumors of monster-infested waters.",,3
Burglar,Burglars specialize in breaking and entering to rob homes and businesses. These criminals focus on gaining access to secure buildings and bypassing traps and other security measures while remaining undetected all the while.,Criminals,4
Buso,"Busos are tree-dwelling folk with a simmering desire to consume the flesh of others. They heavily supplement their food with leaves and root crops, possess significant knowledge of agriculture, and boast innate powers over plants and their growth. In regards to meat, however, busos reject the flesh of beasts; they instead consume other humanoids. Not only do they find the taste of other creatures repulsive, but their bodies reject non-humanoid meat since it provides them no nutritional value and consuming it leaves them sickened and weak. Busos' unusual dietary needs mean they're almost always at odds with neighboring cultures. They typically maintain decent relations only with goblins, who are as a people less prone to judging others based on diet. Other communities fear busos—with some justification—though aside from the occasional forays to harvest someone for their next meal, busos tend to keep to themselves. In some desperate locations, communities faced with famine or other natural disasters might even seek out busos' aid, offering victims in exchange for knowledge or magical assistance that might save their communities from slow and terrible deaths through starvation. A buso's single eye sometimes leads to them being compared to cyclopes. However, both types of creatures deny any common ancestry, and they first appeared independently in entirely different parts of the world with substantially divergent abilities. For their part, busos believe that their ancestors' deeds gave rise to their single eyes. When faced with a famine that threatened their existence, these ancestors each cut out one of their eyes as an offering to the malevolent spirits of the forest, imploring for their salvation. Busos say that these spirits, whom they call the busaw, gave them their knowledge of agriculture, power over plants, and craving for sentient flesh. Henceforth, they revered the busaw as gods and called themselves buso: those who worship the busaw.",,3
Bythos,"The bythos is a guardian of space and time, and at all times seeks out those who misuse planar and temporal magic. A bythos is a roughly humanoid creature with four arms and a body made of swirling clouds and mist. Despite its appearance, its body feels like dry stone. A bythos seeks out paradoxes caused by irresponsible planar or dimensional travelers and repairs breaches where the barriers between planes have become thin or damaged. If the mortals responsible remain in the area and cannot be convinced to cease their activities, the bythos has no qualms about removing them. Using its ability to manipulate time, a bythos might cause an opponent to quickly die of old age as time speeds up around them, or cause a target to disappear from time and space.",Aeon,16
Cacodaemon,"These embodiments of demented violence and spite are spawned from eddies of angry and warped souls amid Abaddon’s mists. Cacodaemons constantly hunger for mortal souls and yearn to create suffering. As gnashing spheres of teeth, fins, and spines, they are the weakest of daemonkind, an amalgam of various petty forms of death without the strength that comes from focusing on a single cause of demise.",Daemon,1
Cactus Leshy,"These little plants are known for their nettlesome attitude. Their personalities mirror the spines that sprout from all over their bodies, making them cantankerous and slightly prickly, though they are unswervingly loyal to those who earn their trust. At home in dry and arid landscapes, cactus leshys store water inside their bodies in order to survive these harsh conditions. Cactus leshys come in all different shapes and colors: tall and thin, with beautiful, vibrantly colored blooms on their heads; squat and rotund, with rows and rows of orderly spines; or seemingly haphazard, with flat segments stacked end to end as if they were balancing on one another.",Leshy,2
Cadaverous Rake,"When a skilled duelist is killed, on occasion they rise as a cadaverous rake, refusing to let death get in the way of daring deeds. Appearing as a corpse-like version of their living form, a cadaverous rake retains their memories and much of their personality. The first act of many cadaverous rakes is to pay a surprise visit to family and friends, unveiling their revival. If they're met with revulsion or attempts to lay them to rest, the rake typically lashes out at the perceived betrayal or departs in offended confusion. Cadaverous rakes who are appropriately feted by friends and family often retain an affection and attachment, becoming undying protectors. This isn't necessarily a good thing, however, as the cadaverous rake's undead worldview creates impossible demands. The transition to undeath corrupts previously benevolent individuals, and their single-minded focus on finding more opponents to duel cuts a bloody swath across stretches of countryside they once protected. Rarely, those who were especially virtuous retain some of their moral code, though even then their dispositions are mercurial. All, however, retain the flamboyance and swagger that made them notable in life, as quick with a quip as they are with a blade. The impulse to toy with their opponents becomes the undoing of many an overconfident rake. Though most cadaverous rakes rise after losing a duel, especially those that involved foul play, any cause of death can suffice, save for a peaceful passing in old age.",,8
Cairn Linnorm,"Cairn linnorms are disturbing, even by linnorm standards. They make their homes in necropolises, burial grounds, and the sites of immense and gory battles. Some point out that cairn linnorms feast on shambling undead and thus provide a service to the living, but these beasts are not choosy and will happily consume any creature, whether or not it draws breath. Some tales state that cairn linnorms will not—or cannot—enter a tomb without the permission of a descendant of the deceased (or the permission of the deceased itself, in the instance that it has risen from the dead). Likewise, once a cairn linnorm has entered a tomb, it won't leave until it has secured permission to do so. Whether such legends are true or not is anyone's guess; nevertheless, reports of a cairn linnorm in the vicinity are harrowing enough to dissuade even the most foolhardy grave robber from peeking into too many crypts or mausoleums.",Linnorm,18
Cairn Wight,"Jealous guardians of tombs, barrows, and sepulchers, cairn wights usually spawn from necromantic rituals. For those mortals who cannot abide the thought of separation from their earthly possessions, the undead existence offered by transformation into a cairn wight can be tempting. Perhaps as frequently, particularly avaricious and wealthy royalty or merchants seek out victims to transform into cairn wights to guard their precious wealth for all time. Only in the rarest instances is the greed of a mortal strong enough to spontaneously transform them into a cairn wight without a dark ritual or the intercession of a powerful divine being. On those occasions, however, the resultant wight exhibits unmatched viciousness and likely owns rare treasure indeed. As guardians of material possessions, cairn wights are supernaturally bound to the armaments they wore during the ritual used to create them. They can spread their necromantic powers into the weapons they wield. A slash from a cairn wight's sword channels life from the victim into the wight.",Wight,4
Calathgar,"Calathgars are mysterious predatory plants that grow in the depths of the densest frozen forests, realms where icicles rarely melt from snow-cloaked trees. A calathgar's blue flowers grow from 3 to 5 feet across (with specimens as wide as 10 feet reported), while the plant itself stands just under 4 feet in height and weighs up to 50 pounds when heavy with seeds.Calathgars' psyches are alien to most sapient creatures. They have little interest in emotion, culture, or ambition, yet they have nearly flawless memories and can share experiences with other calathgars by scent (perceptible to other creatures as a vinegary odor that may reveal their presence) as easily as humanoids can pass on information by speech. While calathgars themselves can't speak, they can typically be reasoned with—though like most protective parents, an incensed calathgar defending its young is rarely in a mood to listen.",,4
Caligni Caller,"Although the mysterious demigods known as the Forsaken disappeared eons ago, many calignis continue to follow their ancient traditions of worship. Owbs, once the Forsaken's servants, still respond to caligni prayers. Caligni callers serve as the priests of their communities, calling upon these shadowy owb patrons for guidance, favors, and power. Their most important ceremony, the blanching, determines the potential of most newborn calignis and shapes their eventual forms. Due to their close ties to the malevolent owbs, most callers exhibit cruel and inscrutable natures. They often lead caligni enclaves alongside caligni stalkers as spiritual advisors. Callers tend to be highly superstitious, seeing omens everywhere, and they avoid revealing details of their rituals even to other calignis.",Caligni,6
Caligni Creeper,The most widespread of the caligni are the mischievous caligni creepers.,Caligni,2
Caligni Dancer,Caligni dancers serve as intermediaries between caligni clans.,Caligni,1
Caligni Slayer,"Caligni slayers possess greater occult talents than others of their kind. In most other calignis, the power bartered from the long-lost demigods known as the Forsaken merely burns within. But in caligni slayers, this power is a deep and terrible hunger. Slayers embrace their evil impulses as a result, and they seek to feed on others with their soul harvest ability to keep this supernatural hunger sated. Slayers denied the opportunity to feed descend into paranoia and, eventually, murderous rage.Delayed feeding improves but never fully restores their composure and patience. Perhaps the greatest manifestation of a slayer's hunger appears at the moment of their death. Upon its last breath, a slayer collapses into itself in a violent, lightless implosion, rather than the blinding eruption of other calignis' deaths, consuming the body itself in a final attempt at satiation.Slayers view themselves as the cleverest and most gifted of the calignis. They seethe with ill-concealed envy at the position of power caligni stalkers occupy, ever scheming to displace them and claim that power for their own. For their part, stalkers tolerate these machinations as an acceptable price for the talents slayers contribute to an enclave. If necessary, any slayer who grows too ambitious can become a brave sacrifice in battle, for the good of the enclave. In physical stature, slayers fall between the willowy caligni dancers and the diminutive creepers. Stalkers tower above most slayers—yet another source of slayers' envy and resentment.",Caligni,3
Caligni Stalker,Caligni stalkers are often leaders of caligni enclaves.,Caligni,4
Caligni Vanguard,"Caligni children born without eyes—an extremely rare occurrence—are considered sacred to their communities. From a young age, they're set aside and groomed to become caligni vanguards, dedicated to rigorous martial training and mental strictures. Other calignis revere vanguards' discipline and combat skill, but wary caution always tinges such respect, as they often have inscrutable motives. Vanguards almost never rebel against their duties or their established role in the community; some claim that those who do are taken by the owbs. A vanguard's armor is fused to their body in pieces, and they rarely remove those elements that aren't. This armor plating and vanguards' keen sense of hearing render them particularly sensitive to sonic vibrations, which serves as both an asset and a vulnerability.",Caligni,5
Calikang,"Calikangs are giant, blue-skinned, six-armed guardians of ancient tombs and treasuries. They each feel a deep, inherent drive to protect and guard, making them highly sought after as wardens and bodyguards. Because most serve as solitary guardians, few calikang societies exist. Calikangs' unique physiologies enable them to absorb and manipulate electrical magic as well as other energies. They can live for 200 years—though they can further extend their lives via suspended animation. For this reason, many are chosen to guard tombs or other sealed sites where living guardians would perish and constructs would deteriorate.",,12
Camarach,"Planar travel is at best imprecise, yet still too predictable for the erratic nature of the Maelstrom. Camaraches are spontaneous manifestations of the Maelstrom resisting the imposed order required to erect planar gates. Camaraches rarely leave the Maelstrom, but the internal skin of their rocky bodies constantly splits into temporary extraplanar portals and collapses again. The planar travel a camarach produces is wholly random, and even the camarach has no inkling where it sends victims.",,17
Camel,"For generations untold, nomads and traders have relied on sure-footed camels to cross the harsh deserts and trackless wastes around the world. Thriving where other animals wither and perish, camels are well-adapted to their homes with tough skin and the ability to store nutrients within their bodies. Properly cared for, these “ships of the desert” can trek for weeks between oases without trouble.  Camels have three eyelids to protect them from desert sands and other blowing debris. One lid is completely clear, which allows them to see and travel during high winds. When sandstorms strike, camels completely close their nostrils to protect their lungs. Their underbellies also sport a thick, specialized skin, allowing them to lay down safely on burning hot sands.  Contrary to popular belief, fatty tissue comprises a camel's humps rather than water. This stored energy allows the animals to survive long distances between feedings. These herbivores can also readily digest hardy scrub brush inedible to other species, making them one of the hardiest desert survivors. Strong as a warhorse, camels can run fast and even sprint for short periods of time when they feel threatened, though they prefer a slow, plodding pace to conserve energy. One-humped camels, also called dromedaries, are more common in the deserts of northern Garund, while the two-humped variety are native to the dry steppes of Casmaron. Both species have tall and lanky builds, standing about 6 feet at the shoulder and weighing around 2,000 pounds. They can be ornery when mishandled, and they don't hesitate to bite, kick, or even spit a noxious substance on riders who don't treat them well.  In addition to transporting people and goods, camels are a key source of fiber for clothing and tents as well as milk. Their meat is highly nutritious and surprisingly tasty, but given the creatures' utility, this use is reserved for special occasions or truly dire situations.",,1
Canopy Elder,"In the densest and oldest jungles, arboreals can reach heights of 200 feet or more. Given thousands of undisturbed years, these massive creatures enter into a symbiotic relationship with a myriad of plants, fungi, and animals to achieve the esteemed status of canopy elder. They provide a safe home for the creatures they host and develop a variety of powers that help them defend their forest realms.",Arboreal,19
Capritellix,"The Plane of Metal can seem unpredictable to the point of cruelty, and capritellixes embody this perfectly. With a head formed of discs that each depict a portion of their face, a capritellix reshapes their personality with a quick whir. Despite their different faces, each capritellix has a unified identity, with one memory and one name. Each mood that cycles through the pieces of their face is a massively amplified facet of their personality, rather than a completely different individual. The differences are subtle to most observers, but a capritellix can display numerous mood combinations—typically 64 for one with four faces per disc or 125 for one with five faces per disc. No matter how much they change their face, however, capritellixes can't suppress their haughty ego or shake the ceaseless despair they feel. The conflicting priorities of each mood within a capritellix make it difficult for any of these creatures to make long-term plans or form solid relationships. What one face builds up, another undermines, cursed all the while with full knowledge of the former intentions they will never fulfill and the well-laid plans they will abandon.",,17
Capstan Swabbie,"Capstan swabbies are constructs specially designed for seafaring. Sea captains looking for unwavering loyalty and competence can do far worse than a swabbie. Built to resemble and assume the place of a ship's capstan—the winch that raises and lowers the anchor—a capstan swabbie is a round, stout cylinder of wood wrapped in heavy-duty rope. Spars spaced evenly around its frame complete the look, while castors on its base give the swabbie mobility. A capstan swabbie also sports a few small pegs around its diameter. It can use these appendages to “grab” other ropes from the rigging to help sail the ship. Some crews decorate their capstan swabbies with paint or rags to give the constructs a personal touch. A capstan swabbie instinctively protects its captain's ship. Using short ropes attached to its sides, the swabbie can lash and trip foes or make emergency repairs to itself or its vessel. Far more dangerous, of course, is the anchor to which the swabbie's longest rope is attached. A capstan swabbie can swing this anchor in wide arcs and reel it back in at a moment's notice.",,7
Captain of the Guard,"The captain of the guard leads a troop of soldiers who serve as security forces for a powerful individual, most often a high-ranking noble or very rich merchant, though this stat block could also represent a lower-ranking captain of the guard for the leader of a nation. A formidable opponent in their own right, the captain of the guard skillfully employs their troops to protect the life and health of their ward.",Officers,6
Carbuncle,"Never have legend and misinformation met upon a more inauspicious brow than that of the lowly carbuncle. At first glance, carbuncles appear to be little more than ungainly reptiles. What sets them apart is their strange magical abilities and the gemstone-like horn protruding from between their goggling eyes. Although rumors suggest various uses for carbuncle horns, ranging from miracle cure-alls to potent magical components, the truth is much more mundane: a carbuncle's horn is merely a highly reflective growth, not unlike a fingernail.",,1
Carnivorous Blob,"Carnivorous blobs are the ravenous spawn of shattered worlds far beyond the stars, born across the galaxy in inert form until they fall like meteorites onto unsuspecting worlds. These massive beings can lie dormant for years in desolate caverns or barren wastelands. When a carnivorous blob perceives living creatures nearby, it lurches to gelatinous life, seeking out and consuming every creature it can catch until it is destroyed or until it has been unable to locate food for 24 hours, at which point it returns to hibernation. Often, keeping food away from a carnivorous blob is the safest way to defeat it. The blob's ability to split into smaller oozes that might stay hidden after a fight means it can be hard to fully eradicate these mindless predators.",Ooze,13
Carnivorous Crystal,"Carnivorous crystals are strange ooze creatures native to the Plane of Earth. Unlike most oozes, their bodies are not homogeneously fluid; rather, interspersed within their glassy, viscous resin are thousands of sharp mineral formations that nevertheless possess some of the same flexibility and mobility as the rest of the creature’s gooey body.",,11
Carrion Golem,"Carrion golems are foul-smelling and fly-swarmed amalgams of putrefied parts stitched together from many different creatures. Unlike most golems, carrion golems only rarely are given a humanoid form, instead appearing more twisted and bestial in frame. As a result, some students of golem crafting claim that the carrion golem isn't a “true golem,” but regardless of those claims these foul constructs certainly share other golem-like traits, including their significant immunities. What is true is that most who craft carrion golems don't do so out of true interest in the technique of golem crafting, but for the golem's ability to spread disease. The crafters of carrion golems send their mindless minions to cause immediate destruction and leave wakes of illness and death behind them.",Golem,4
Carved Beast,"An untold number of stumps carved into roughly hewn animal shapes roam the Plane of Wood. The statue portion of these carved beasts is incapable of articulated movement, though the living wood at their base is fully animate. When left to their own devices, carved beasts prefer to roughly mimic the behaviors of the animals they resemble, like children playing with inarticulate toys.","Elemental, Wood",6
Cassisian,"The weakest of angels, cassisians usually serve as lackey messengers for more powerful angels or as spiritual guides for mortals.

Castoroides,Castoroides are bear-sized beavers that build their lodges on land near a water source rather than in the water.,Beaver,3
Cat Sith,"Cat siths can easily pass for common black house cats, noteworthy only for the white spots on their chests and their unusually bristly personalities. In actuality, they are cunning fey, fully capable of speech, trickery, and even walking upright on their hind legs and using their forepaws almost as skillfully as hands. Cat siths live around highland towns and cities, regularly venturing unnoticed into nearby communities by posing as domesticated felines or using magic to take humanoid form. While some cat siths gather information and undertake tasks for more powerful fey creatures, others serve only their own mysterious agendas. Cat siths are harbingers of misfortune and find amusement in the unluckiness that follows in their wake. Though they are rarely malicious, they are fascinated by death in all its forms, and may go so far as to steal the souls of the dying for some inscrutable purpose.",,6
Catfolk Pouncer,Catfolk pouncers travel the world in search of new experiences.,Catfolk,1
Catoblepas,"The catoblepas is an aggressive beast at the best of times. Though it prefers swamps, the catoblepas has been know to forage in plains and forests for short periods, leaving behind hunting grounds tainted by its foul breath and noxious waste that other predators and prey alike avoid for days or even weeks thereafter. The catoblepas bullies those creatures it believes are a match for it, and eats everything weaker.A catoblepas is 15 feet long and weighs 2,200 pounds.",,12
Catrina,"Not all spirits who enter the Boneyard realize they have died. Catrinas meet these souls, helping to convince them of the finality of their fate to ease a spirit's passing. Catrinas are more likely to intervene when a mortal can't accept their death. They perform their task to keep the afterlife calm, rather than out of true compassion for a mortal's grief. Catrinas only rarely visit the Material Plane, typically to help an extremely important mortal pass on. Catrinas resemble skeletons dressed in bright flowers and colorful dresses, giving them a simultaneously festive and macabre appearance. Though most catrinas present as feminine, masculine catrinas still dress in bright colors and carry garlands of flowers.",Psychopomp,5
Caulborn,"Telepathic prophets and historians, caulborn gather in small cabals for protection and camaraderie, using their collective brainpower to unravel cosmic conundrums. Once they've exhausted an area's secrets, they depart, seeking new homes hidden within cities, sequestering themselves within caves, or lurking in forgotten corners of the planes. From the moment an ioton absorbs especially profound thoughts and begins taking on the permanent form of a young caulborn, these ennosites' genius and toughness grow with each new discovery. Absorbing such information destabilizes their corporeal form, like when books are stacked too high, so excess knowledge seeps from a caulborn's body, causing a literal brain drain that caulborn find incredibly vexing. To avoid this occurrence, caulborn must feed on others' psychic energy to maintain themselves, which is usually a harmless process. Especially hungry caulborn even abduct prey. Despite their need to feed, caulborn rarely care to interact with other creatures, especially beings that could react to their appearance with fear or hostility. They occasionally make exceptions for accomplished scholars or storied travelers, however, bartering their own lore for outside secrets.",Ennosite,7
Caustic Monitor,"Caustic monitors are enormous lizards native to eastern Minata known and named for the corrosive enzyme in their mucus, saliva, and other bodily fluids. These corrosive fluids originally developed as a means of protection from large insects such as giant mosquitos. The thick layer of mucus that naturally coats the monitors' scaly skin makes it difficult for most other creatures to get too close, let alone prey upon the lizard. Caustic monitors also use their corrosive biological features to their hunting advantage, particularly by expelling the acidic contents of their stomach at prey. Even when not making use of their acid, caustic monitors can be deadly predators: They grab onto smaller creatures using their powerful forelimb muscles and are remarkably agile, considering their size and weight. Most caustic monitors live among rocky terrain such as pebble beaches, natural caves, and along sandy river shoals. A caustic monitor's mucus corrodes only flesh, so its den is safe from damage, but corroded plant life near a cave is a telltale sign that a caustic monitor lives nearby. Hardy adventurers and fortune seekers must weigh the potential benefits of hunting this beast—as its acid is highly prized among alchemists—against the obvious risks.",Lizard,13
Cauthooj,"These large, flightless birds are deceptively agile, considering their long bodies and awkward, hopping gait. Solitary predators, they use their hypnotic warbling song to drive prey into a wild frenzy, manipulating them into attacking one another so that the cauthooj can then feast on the remains. Known to some scholars as the puppet master bird, and to others as the shrill shrike, cauthoojs are widely reviled by most intelligent humanoids, in part because the birds seem to prefer humanoids to other prey. Cauthooj sightings typically lead to the creation of hunting parties to track the creature down before it can kill again, with would-be hunters typically stuffing their ears full of wax in an effort to avoid being affected by its cry. Those who have survived the creature’s song report that the experience is uniquely unnerving, and almost all accounts agree that there is no other sound as terrible. While one might assume the cauthooj is a dumb animal, these creatures are in fact quite a bit smarter than they look. Cauthoojs stalk the perimeter of remote settlements in hopes of finding a lone traveler they can feast upon. These patient creatures will wait in ambush as long as they must to sate their hunger. They can even understand a few rudimentary words in Sylvan, although they are incapable of clearly speaking themselves. This doesn’t stop the cauthooj from attempting to mimic the sounds it hears, but when it does so, its eerie primal nature enhances the attempt, leading to the bird’s signature ability to manipulate minds and encourage conflict, a trait the cauthooj is just barely smart enough to understand—and enjoy.",,12
Cave Bear,"Larger, stronger, and far more aggressive than its smaller cousins, the cave bear is a behemoth that avoids civilized lands, preferring to dwell in remote places. As its name might suggest, the cave bear makes its den in natural caves, and like the grizzly bear, a cave bear is fiercely territorial. Unlike a grizzly bear, however, a cave bear is short tempered and will make sure its foe is dead before moving on, usually feasting on its prey’s soft flesh once it has been incapacitated. Cave bears are often regarded as powerful guardian spirits by remote-dwelling people, while they are utilized as beasts of war by orcs or even giants—stone giants in particular have an affinity for keeping trained cave bears as pets or guardians for their homes.",Bear,6
Cave Fisher,"Cave fishers lurk in dark corners near the ceilings of caves and underground structures, lying in wait for prey to approach. When it does, the cave fisher excretes thin, tough, and very sticky filaments at its prey with lightning speed to capture it.A cave fisher eats just about any live prey smaller than itself, though anything smaller than a rat isn't much of a meal for it. When a cave fisher captures such a creature, it often leaves the hapless animal entangled, using it as bait to attract larger creatures. Because the adhesive on its filament doesn't last long, the fisher frequently needs to eat one filament and excrete a new one. The filaments are translucent and can be hard to see when they're still and in darkness.Cave fishers hatch with the ability to excrete filaments, but they molt many times before reaching their adult size of about 7 feet long and 400 pounds. They often leave shed shells in conspicuous locations as decoys.",,2
Cave Giant,"Cave giants are the vicious loners of the giant world. Even their closest ancestral kin, the rampaging hill giants, mostly find cave giants too brutal and antisocial to form alliances with. For their part, cave giants—garbed in stinking hides festooned with the rotting skulls of their victims—seem ambivalent about their foul reputation. They are more interested in hunting and killing their next meal than forming alliances. For all their disregard of others' opinions, cave giants are cautious when it comes to defending territory. Cave giant traps are simple yet effective, such as rounded boulders that can be pushed down steep tunnels, camouflaged pits filled with sharpened stakes, and even compromised stalactites that can suddenly fall on unsuspecting intruders. In coastal towns and hillside villages with caves a common feature of the landscape, cave giants star as common villains in local tall tales. Many youngsters and aspiring heroes dare one another to venture into remote grottoes or abandoned mine shafts in the hopes of discovering a cave giant, and all too often their searches prove successful. Grieving villagers pay skilled adventures handsomely to locate the whereabouts of their missing kin. The bounty for such hunts might be as much as an entire village harvest's worth of gold, particularly if a local cave giant has been a frequent enough menace or the missing villager is particularly beloved.",Giant,6
Cave Scorpion,"Cave scorpions prefer to reside in underground lairs. Most have lost nearly all of their pigmentation, making them appear ghostly when they lurk at the edge of the light. While they prefer to eat large insects, cave scorpions can and will attack humanoids. Some Darklands societies have developed techniques to herd or lure scorpions into pest-infested tunnels and warrens at the edge of their settlements, where the scorpions thrive in a dual role of exterminators and guardians.",Scorpion,1
Cavern Troll,"Insatiable scavengers stalking the eternal gloom of the Darklands, cavern trolls consume all in their path—even rocks and minerals when more nourishing sustenance is scarce. These rocky goliaths can tunnel through stone with their iron-sharp claws. Cavern trolls rarely venture to the surface world, for they have a debilitating vulnerability to sunlight that petrifies them on sustained contact. Unlike common trolls, cavern trolls can regenerate wounds dealt by fire. The crystalline nature of their skin, however, permits sonic attacks to neutralize their signature regeneration. As cavern trolls age, their flinty skin becomes studded with small crystals and stones of various composition. Paragons of their kind have toothy maws replete with large, crystalline fangs. A typical cavern troll stands 14 feet in height and weighs about 2,000 pounds.",Troll,6
Cecaelia Trapper,"Cecaelias resemble humans with octopus tentacles instead of legs. These oceanic hunters are agile and intelligent creatures, but proud. Their inquisitiveness often brings them into contact with strangers, where a poor turn of phrase or an unintended insult can quickly spark their legendary tempers. Cecaelias live nomadic lives, hunting and scavenging along coastlines for food and tradeable trinkets. They engage in frequent trade with terrestrial communities, offering anything from seafood to treasures retrieved from sunken vessels in exchange for goods not readily available underwater. Some take to piracy or hire themselves out as mercenaries, but their quarrelsome disposition invariably leads to them going their own way again before too long. The only non-cecaelia communities that maintain long-lasting relationships with cecaelias are those of the remarkably laid-back locathahs, who coexist with cecaelias in the city of Xidao. Cecaelias live in warm waters along verdant ocean reefs or coastlines, often near humanoid settlements. Able to adapt rapidly over a few generations, cecaelias adopt the physical features of their closest humanoid neighbors, which sages liken to an octopus's natural camouflage.",Cecaelila,5
Centaur,"Centaurs are legendary hunters and trackers who resemble heavily muscled humans with the bodies of powerful horses from the waist down. They are typically reclusive but haughty, quick to assume that their handsome physiques and long history of cultural traditions make them superior to any two-legged folk they encounter. While stories of bloody clashes between centaurs and humanoid settlers are well known, centaurs are neither intrinsically bloodthirsty nor recklessly aggressive. Rather, they are proud and stubborn and do not take kindly to outsiders who encroach on their ancestral grounds, some of which have been ruled by centaurs for thousands of years. Against despoilers of nature who fail to heed their warnings, centaurs do not hesitate to use their finely honed hunting skills to inflict deadly wounds. Centaurs train with weapons as well as their heavy hooves, and the thunder of centaurs charging across the plains is often mistaken for a stampede or even an earthquake. Despite their insular nature, some centaurs form close alliances with elves, fey, gnomes, and isolated human communities. Such allies are often surprised to learn the depths of centaurs’ honor, pragmatism, and wilderness lore. Rarely, a centaur leaves its tribe to travel the wider world. Such lone centaur wanderers more easily integrate into humanoid societies, but other centaurs are quick to assume that some dishonor led to their exile and thus give such vagabonds a wide berth. Centaurs have incredible variation in their individual size and coloration. Their upper bodies are fairly similar within a tribe and even region, but their lower bodies—like those of horses—can vary widely from parent to child. Most centaurs are at least 7 feet tall and weigh more than 2,000 pounds. Centaurs live in groups of dozens of members, usually led by an old, powerful seer or battle-hardened warrior who has carried out many noble deeds and earned a lifetime of respect from their comrades. The revered leader guides the habits of their entire group; a wise seer might encourage the tribe to roam far from civilization to preserve the ways of its ancestors, while an aggressive warrior might foster skirmishes with nearby humanoid settlements and even rival centaur groups.",,3
Centipede Swarm,"Swarms of centipedes are dangerous indeed, ravenous carpets of skittering hunger capable of devouring a traveler whole in a matter of minutes. Some alchemists submerge whole centipedes taken from swarms in their elixirs and some mutagens, claiming such infusions increase potency, though other say this is nothing more than quackish claptrap. Kobolds and mitflits are both known to incorporate swarms of centipedes into cunning traps, from simple pits filled with vermin or more complex affairs involving chutes that dump the vermin onto the heads of unwary intruders.",Centipede,3
Ceustodaemon,"Ceustodaemons are formed from the souls of vile mortals, particularly those who took efforts to hasten their own death, their willingness shaping them into daemonic servants. Their otherworldly senses make them useful for protecting vaults and similar locations on the Material Plane. Ceustodaemons are created to serve, but always seek ways to subvert their bindings, so they can rend their mortal summoners’ flesh. The worst type of conjurer calls upon ceustodaemons merely to set them free into the world in hopes of currying favor with the powers of Abaddon.",Daemon,6
Changeling Exile,This changeling exile is the child of a night hag or dreamthief hag.,Changeling,3
Charghar,"Common urban legends in Geb warn of the vengeful spirits of those who've been cooked alive, collectively called charghars. While many Gebbites eat people in ways that don't involve cooking, there are some undead who've grown bored after centuries of the same diet. There are also some living people in the nation who've resorted to cannibalism: either downtrodden folks who cook and eat their neighbors and kin out of necessity, or socialites who dine on such fare because it's fashionable. Regardless of the reason for cooking people, these efforts can create vengeful undead creatures who lurk wherever meals are being prepared, luring cooks into making careless or deadly mistakes. Charghars have spectral humanoid forms, while their physical manifestations appear much as they did after they were cooked—as charred remains, gory corpses bearing disembodied butchered chunks that float nearby, or loose assemblages of boiled bones.",,4
Charlatan,"Charlatans use pretense and misdirection to swindle money and other valuables from the credulous and confused. Selling snake oil (literally or figuratively), distracting marks to pick their pockets, or faking mediumship are classic grifts.",Criminals,3

Chernobue,"The chernobue infects all creatures it encounters with itself, spreading pain and calamity wherever it flops and writhes. It sheds ruin and sups on anguish, but a chernobue can sometimes be persuaded to pause for a few moments of conversation if its partner in discourse can keep its attention by providing enough atrocious details. Resembling a tumor-like growth of oily blackness, this vile monstrosity has numerous muscular tentacles, a single glaring baleful eye, and a drooling, toothy maw in the middle of its body.",Qlippoth,12
Child of Urgathoa,"Only the most fanatic followers of Urgathoa, goddess of disease, gluttony, and undeath, could ever hope to become a child of Urgathoa. These “blessed” undead can't be created by any save Urgathoa herself, and the blessing must be bestowed at the moment of death. Those rare few chosen by their goddess to serve as undying vessels for her power are revered by Urgathoa's faithful. Most surround themselves with fanatic cults or undead armies, subjugating and terrorizing secluded communities. Children of Urgathoa are arrogant, notoriously cruel, and utterly devoted to their goddess and her teachings. They show no favor to members of their faith, inflicting pain and sowing infection throughout Urgathoa's clergy as often as unaffiliated victims. Children of Urgathoa are at their most sadistic while punishing heretics, particularly those who prove too afraid to accept the goddess's gifts of death and undeath.",,8
Children Of Mhar,"Mhar, an ancient evil deity of caverns, mountains, and volcanoes, belongs to the pantheon of the Great Old Ones—monstrous beings of alien intellect and unfathomable power. The so-called children of Mhar (known as deghuuns in the chaotic tongues of Mhar's enraptured cultists) physically resemble blue-gray octopods made of stone, mud, and molten iron. Venthole-like craters dot the surface of a deghuun's body, through which the creature can gaze out with a single golden eye that it can move from crater to crater.",,18
Chimera,"The chimera is the archetypal example of an unnatural monster made up of a monstrous mix of wildly different component creatures: in this case, a lion, a dragon, and a goat. Wild, hateful, and hungry, it tries to eat any creature it sees, but sometimes a strong-willed master is able to compel a chimera to serve as a guardian or even a mount.",,8
Chimpanzee Visitant,Common circus animals viewed as expendable by their caretakers are perhaps the most likely to rise as visitants. Animals that die en masse—such as in a tent fire or other disaster—can even form packs of roving undead.,Visitant,3
Choker,"With long, cartilaginous limbs and gray skin, chokers easily hide in stony alcoves, rocky fissures, and darkened staircases to ambush their prey. The strange little aberrations prefer to pick off weak and solitary creatures, especially those that wander off from their packs or communities. A choker's long, spongy arms are flexible but deceptively strong. The fingers can tighten rapidly and are ridged with spiky, tooth-like structures that provide an incredible grip. A choker typically strangles its prey to death, then drags the body off or dismembers it using crude tools if the body is too big to carry. If confronted or outnumbered, a choker tries to escape, often compressing into a tight passage to get away. Chokers that encounter humanoids exhibit intense curiosity about their culture, society, and the products of art and industry. This interest isn't very deep—it just results in chokers that like killing people and collecting any of their items that seem sophisticated, such as jewelry, nice clothing, or written texts.Chokers sometimes gather in settlements, usually sticking to slums or abandoned structures. These chokers stalk at night, flopping across rooftops, tapping at windows, and scuttling through sewers, gutters, and chimneys to get at prey. An urban choker that finds prey early on its hunt—a wandering pet, a person who is out alone—might spend the rest of the night indulging its curiosity about the products of society. A curious choker might abscond with all sorts of odd items, from tavern signs to library books to roof tiles. A choker usually pilfers only one item at a time, but as its collection grows, it might need to find a larger nest to accommodate its collection, then move its pieces one by one to the new home.",,2
Choral,"Choral angels are incredible singers who fill the halls of Nirvana with pious chants and sacred hymns. They form from the souls of talented bards and other performers. While they shy away from conflict, they occasionally brave the mortal realm to deliver good omens and auspicious messages. Choral angels often serve the goddess Shelyn, but they can also serve other good deities and empyreal lords.",Angel,6
Chouchin-Obake,"A chouchin-obake takes the shape of a paper lantern with a horizontal split near the bottom from which a long tongue protrudes. Upon closer inspection, two eyes appear above the split mouth. Chouchin-obake are anomalous in that they don't awaken in the same way other tsukumogami do. Paper lanterns are nearly impossible to maintain for long enough to spawn tsukumogami. Instead, a chouchin-obake is a kind of fire kami that takes the form of a lantern's flame and inhabits a paper lantern when they manifest.",Tsukumogami,6
Chromatic Ooze,"Chromatic oozes result from the worst kind of alchemical mishaps: attempts to combine as many types of elemental damage as possible into a single alchemical substance. Although the source of these alchemical concatenations are as varied as the alchemists who attempt to distill them, one of the most common methods for creating them involves combining the essences of multiple types of chromatic dragons together using eldritch alchemical processes. When this type of experimentation goes dangerously wrong—as it often does—the result is a combination of terrible elemental power with the mindless destructive power of an ooze. A chromatic ooze is a rippling, seething substance that shifts through several different colors, but chemical reactions within the ooze can lock its energy and its color into a specific phase for a short time. Whether a chromatic ooze's destructive urges derive from the frustrated ingenuity of an alchemist creator or from the hunger of the chromatic dragons that so often constitute these oozes' forms, the best way to deal with a chromatic ooze is to stay out of its way.",Ooze,18
Chronicler,Exploration means very little if no account of the details exist. Members of adventuring bands cherish chroniclers who record tales of their deeds.,Explorers,3
Chupacabra,"These notorious predators have an undeniable thirst for blood. Chupacabras prefer to prey upon the weak and slow, often hiding in wait and watching potential prey for long periods before attacking. Spry and stealthy, they most often make their homes in areas of high grass and protective rock, their slightly reflective scales allowing them to blend in well with such surroundings.Chupacabras prefer to eat lone travelers and farm animals (particularly goats), and leave little evidence of their presence apart from the grisly, blood-drained husks of their meals. Their tendency to stay out of sight combined with their naturally nocturnal activity often leads superstitious locals to conclude the worst, imagining that a particularly reckless vampire lives in the area.A typical chupacabra measures nearly 5-1/2 feet from its muzzle to the tip of its spiny tail, and it stands just under 4 feet tall. With their slight build and lightweight bones, most weigh close to 100 pounds. They mate rarely and only during the hottest months, with the females each producing a single egg that hatches into a tiny, dehydrated creature. The mother typically leaves helpless prey in her cave so the hatchling can immediately feed.Although chupacabras are typically solitary creatures, they have been known to form small gangs in bountiful areas. Members of these groups work well together, growing bold enough to attack larger animals, small herds, and otherwise more dangerous prey. Stories of chupacabras attacking travelers or laying siege to farmhouses typically stem from the hunting practices of such gangs. Regions where chupacabra activity like this is more common often have complex and colorful myths and tall tales about chupacabra capabilities or motive —- and a few of the claims, such as that some chupacabras can fly, are all too true.",,3
Chuul,"Also known as chu'ulothis, these large, armor-plated, crustacean predators lurk beneath the surface of pools, mires, and ponds, waiting to snatch up prey with their massive claws before paralyzing them with their tentacles. At that point, they begin to feed, eating their quarry alive. Chuuls can live in fresh or saltwater, and indeed are found in aquatic environs the world over—even in the subterranean oceans and lakes of the Darklands. While chuuls are good swimmers, they prefer terrestrial prey. Their preferred method of hunting is by lunging out of the water, paralyzing their victims with their poison-coated tentacles, then gleefully dragging their twitching food into the water to drown if they cannot simply eat such morsels alive. Chuuls that dwell aboveground prefer to dine on lizardfolk, while those swimming the subterranean lakes of the Darklands readily eat anything but xulgaths, whose flavor and stink they find off-putting. Chuuls are capable of speech and reason, but these creatures rarely speak with those outside their species except to taunt their food. Before it begins consuming its prey, a chuul often speaks in a gurgling, nearly incomprehensible dialect about how it will enjoy feasting on the creature's flesh. Perhaps chuuls believe that insults and degradation lead to more tender and tastier food, but the truth will likely never be known; almost all chuuls stubbornly refuse any meaningful conversation, even when imprisoned and compelled by treats or pain. It is unknown if a chuul society exists beyond their frenzied mating season. Chuuls' intellects seem devoted only toward eating, causing psychological pain to sentient creatures, decorating their lairs with mementos of their favorite meals and victories, and breeding.",,7
Chyzaedu,"Chyzaedus' home world was consumed millennia ago by the Dominion of the Black via the manipulation of a black hole. Rather than accept destruction or fight back, the chyzaedus instead joined forces with their destroyers, seeing in them a greater purpose than mere world domination. Today, chyzaedus serve in a role akin to a priesthood for the Dominion and take a sinister interest in bringing their beliefs to new worlds, teaching ignorant dwellers the glory of pure entropic destruction. Much like the black holes they venerate, chyzaedus possess an eternal hunger for sustenance and knowledge alike—they can never be sated by either, yet they will never starve as long as there are mortals whose energy they can feed upon.",,10
Cinder Rat,"These oversized rodents are made of smoldering charcoal and elemental fire, and noxious fumes continually bellow from their flaming flesh.","Elemental, Fire",3
City Guard Squadron,"Most towns and cities on Golarion have a garrison of professional guards whose duties include patrolling the streets, assisting citizenry in need, and acting as a quick military response in times of crisis. Guards usually operate in pairs or small groups, but when a serious emergency threatens, guards muster at the nearest keep, watch station, or other rallying point and then move out in search of their quarry. Alternatively, guard troops might be stationed at important locations in the city, such as the front gates, the main prison, or the entrance to the ruler's castle. Individual guards may not be particularly well trained or experienced, but in large numbers they can defeat bandits, wild creatures that have slipped past the city gates, or the occasional drunken ogre. A group of city guards is usually accompanied and commanded by a single captain, who does most of the talking and gives individual guards their orders. The members of this city guard squadron have trained together to perform simple tactics but not advanced maneuvers.",,5
Clacking Skull Swarm,"Roiling about in seething waves of bleached death, clacking skull swarms arise from the remains of dozens of beheaded humanoids. The horrible clattering of the skulls' onslaught drives their prey to distraction even while they try to flee in terror.",Skull Swarm,10
Clay Golem,"Traditionally, clay golems are crafted in the image of a deity and used as guardians of tombs or sacred crypts. Clay golems have the power to lay curses upon their victims as punishment for intrusion, leading many to believe that these oft-ancient constructs have a touch of the divine to them. While this idea has little basis in reality, superstitious folk still tread lightly around statues that resemble clay golems even in the slightest. The animating force within a clay golem is unusually unstable, making the golem prone to entering a berserk frenzy when damaged. Entire treasuries have been totally ruined as a result of a rampaging clay golem, so crafters do well to make sure their golems are maintained and in good working order—or otherwise place them on the other side of the door from the treasures they wish to protect.",Golem,10
Cloaker,"Weird and paranoid creatures that dwell in the Darklands, cloakers resemble hideous, flying manta rays. Crafty and careful hunters, their motivations, their patterns of attack, and even their societies and history are often an inscrutable jumble of contradicting reports, confused rumors, and terrifying accounts. Like many of the stranger creatures of Golarion, cloakers were originally created by the alghollthus, who bred them to spy on their Azlanti thralls. Upon the fall of the Azlanti empire, the alghollthus cast out their cloaker creations, who, in turn, fled to the lower reaches of the Darklands. Amid the vaults and twisted corridors of their new home, their attitudes—particularly regarding their apprehension toward their former masters—changed dramatically. Suspicion became paranoia, egotism, sadism, and much worse. Now, most cloakers lead solitary lives, stalking the Darklands for easy prey and delving deeper into internal horrors. Their paranoia is so great that they interact only rarely even with their own kind, encountering another cloaker only briefly to mate before flitting back to isolation. But there are exceptions. Every so often, a charismatic cloaker priest can call together a dark cabal of these creatures and other Darklands denizens to worship unspeakable ancient gods. These rare cloakers whip their acolytes and followers into a frenzy of dark rituals and heinous acts. While these cults are depraved and destructive, they rarely survive longer than their founder.",,5
Clockwork Amalgam,"A clockwork amalgam is a powerful construct created by applying magic to a collection of interchangeable internal mechanisms. Each clockwork amalgam has unique properties, although most stand roughly 12 feet tall and have five clockwork appendages tipped with integrated weapons.",Clockworks,20
Clockwork Assassin,"Exceptionally efficient and utterly merciless, clockwork assassins carry out their murderous directives with mechanical precision. Though they can disguise themselves, upon close inspection, they're plainly artificial, with just a single eye and weapons integrated into their arms.",Clockworks,13
Clockwork Brewer,"With the rise of the automated workforce in Alkenstar came the “professional” line of clockworks, capable of carrying out more complex tasks and even interacting with the public. These clockworks were given modules inscribed with information and procedures for carrying out a specific profession. The clockwork brewer is one such example, capable of extracting wort, stirring a fermenter, or monitoring a boiling temperature. As many other types of clockwork professional exist as there are professions; clockworks have been programmed to reshelf library books, swab ship decks, and fill holes in heavily trafficked roads. Clockwork professionals made by reputable manufacturers are generally considered safe to interact with the public. Accidents have been known to occur, however, particularly when careless engineers fail to perform regular maintenance checks or when operators program a clockwork with insufficiently specific directives. Flesh and blood laborers forced to work in close proximity to a clockwork professional tend to keep a wide berth.",Clockworks,3
Clockwork Buccaneer,"Clockwork buccaneers are powerful constructs designed for naval combat. Whereas most clockwork creations sink to the ocean floor while at sea, clockwork buccaneers can use their water jets to easily propel themselves through the water or leap aboard enemy ships. In addition to an internal water tank and hydraulic pumps, most clockwork buccaneers are equipped with a cutlass and arm gun loaded with scatter shot.",Clockworks,9
Clockwork Clock Tower,Clockworks are machines built by engineers and augmented with magic. A clock tower reconfigured as an animated clockwork can rotate slices of time.,Clockworks,20
Clockwork Disposer,"Wealthy business owners sometimes employ clockwork disposers to pick up trash around their establishment and keep the place tidy. Many are designed with handy (but dangerous) built-in furnaces, which they use to quickly incinerate collected refuse.",Clockworks,5
Clockwork Door Warden,"This mechanical humanoid serves the role of a gatekeeper or even a greeter, but its strength also enables it to repel unwanted visitors.",Clockworks,4
Clockwork Dragon,"Clockwork dragons are a marvel of clockwork design. These powerful masterpieces have the ability to fly, making them versatile and dangerous killers. A clockwork dragon's winding mechanism is more efficient than those of other clockworks, allowing it to partially reuse energy generated by flapping its wings. Creating a clockwork dragon requires not only an advanced understanding of clockwork design, but also a greater cache of rare resources, as its body requires solid reinforcement. As a result, most clockwork dragons have adamantine fortification. Creating a clockwork dragon without adamantine is entirely possible, though such dragons are typically smaller and more fragile.",Clockworks,16
Clockwork Fabricator,"A common sight among Alkenstar work crews, construction teams, and mining operations, the clockwork fabricator is a one-size-fits-all construction companion. These clockworks can be programmed to perform up to two simple, repetitive tasks such as hauling equipment, chopping down trees, or grinding up hunks of ore. The modular nature of these units makes them even more valuable—after finishing a day's work sawing planks, the same machine can be unwound, updated with a new modular arm or two, and then re-wound and given new instructions. While it's possible to remove or replace an arm while a fabricator in use, doing so is dangerous and likely to void the manufacturer's warranty, to say nothing of the danger posed to the engineer doing the retrofitting.",Clockworks,4
Clockwork Handler,"One of the jobs most commonly outsourced to clockworks is guard duty. Clockwork soldiers are often too costly to employ en masse, so municipalities looking to cut corners devised the much-cheaper clockwork handler, a budget-friendly construct sufficient for rat catching, door watching, and basic patrol work. Handlers are typically programmed to react efficiently to certain situations such as intruders or assailants. To that end, all handlers are equipped with an everburning torch fastened to their hooded lantern-like heads. Furthermore, most clockwork handlers used in public places have their fists covered in a padded material to ensure they don't accidentally beat suspects to death, though these modifications are removable (removing the nonlethal trait from their fist Strike). The nonlethal approach is considered the safest, as clockwork creatures don't always have the keenest judgement on who is a criminal and who is a customer. A healthy supply of rope allows the clockwork handler to quickly tie-up unruly vagabonds, that they might be brought to justice.",Clockworks,1
Clockwork Hunter,"Tasks like patrolling the sewers for vermin are mundane, perfect for the clockwork hunter. Its hound-like appearance mimics one of humanity's trustiest hunting companions—with a few choice modifications, of course. Few hunting dogs, for example, sport sturdy metal plating and an integrated crossbow bolt launcher. Over time, clockwork makers have unofficially adopted a common model for the hunter, making it fairly easy to find spare parts or compatible accessory modules. The city of Alkenstar owns a few dozen clockwork hunters for the purpose of keeping sewer tunnels free of vermin. Shieldmarshals sometimes drop boxes of extra crossbow bolts just inside sewer entrances, enabling clockwork hunters to resupply as needed. Other businesses that tend to purchase clockwork hunters include warehouses, butchers, and bakers—essentially, anywhere rats and other vermin tend to congregate. Though quick, a clockwork hunter's body isn't very sturdy and tends to fall apart after only minor abuse. Elite clockwork hunters are fitted with specialty armored plating, giving them resistance 2 to physical damage (except adamantine or orichalcum).",Clockworks,0
Clockwork Mage,A clockwork mage is a lethal blend of magic and machinery. Each of these clockworks is imbued with an arcane stone at its core that powers spells through the wand embedded in its chest.,Clockworks,9
Clockwork Puppeteer,"Clockwork puppeteers are grim constructs capable of controlling corpses like puppets. They typically stand 12 feet tall and have spindly legs and long arms ending with scalpel-like claws. Dozens of metallic strings, composed of interlocking clockwork links, hang from their wrists.",Clockworks,12
Clockwork Soldier,These diligent machines guard their assigned posts tirelessly. A typical clockwork soldier stands 6 feet tall and consists of 500 pounds of metal and magic.,Clockworks,6
Clockwork Sphinx,This imposing construct resembles a bronze lion with the wings of a great bird and the head of a humanoid.,Clockworks,8
Clockwork Spy,"Engineers, technologists, and mechanically gifted wizards employ clockwork spies—tiny, spiderlike constructs capable of recording and playing back audio— to surreptitiously surveil their enemies or steal secrets from competitors. Their spindly bodies and delicate components make them unsuitable for combat; in fact, most builders construct clockwork spies with a self-destruct mechanism to ensure the spies' meddling can't be traced back to them.",Clockworks,-1
Cloud Giant,"The graceful and regal cloud giants have skin of milky white to powdery blue. Unlike most giants, cloud giants are quite morally diverse. A handful are neutral, but of the others, roughly half are good, while the other half are evil. Good cloud giants are often civic-minded builders of roads and settlements, and are interested in trading goods as well as cultural innovations. It’s not uncommon for such giants to approach their neighbors with diplomacy and build strong relationships with other peaceful peoples. Conversely, evil cloud giants are often isolationist and xenophobic. Preferring hidden mountain valleys and settlements in the caves and among the crags of lonely peaks, they raid for what they want and treat other creatures like inconsequential insects. These opposing philosophies can generate a great deal of strife among neighboring cloud giant communities, and the raiders often threaten the trade deals of their peaceful cousins. Legends persist of floating cities ruled by magically gifted cloud giant queens and kings. While most cloud giants plainly state that such claims are pure fantasy, others are mysteriously tight-lipped or evasive about the matter.",Giant,11
Cobblebone Swarm,"Graydirge's necromancer-architects used a horrifying rending process to strip the flesh and souls off most bones involved in Graydirge's construction, but modern builders lack the benefit of such gruesomely efficient magic. When haunted bones are embedded in buildings alongside mundane materials, nearby bricks and cobblestones can be infused with necromantic energy. If no one exorcises the spirits haunting the bones, they become trapped and confused, their identities and memories intermingling. After several years, they can form cobblebone swarms, malevolent haunted amalgamations of brick and bone. These vengeful creatures conjure ghostly noises to lure victims down narrow alleys or into dark stone basements, where they pummel them to death and cover their remains beneath piles of bones and brick. Some have mistaken cobblebone swarms for cobbleswarms, but citizens of Graydirge know to look for nearby apparitions, or studded bones that move when you look away. These are sure signs of a cobblebone swarm, and an indication that one should take a different route to their destination. Cobblebone swarms look like piles of simple bricks or cobblestones with crooked bones embedded in them, often in the shape of crude faces. As they roll along or float slowly through the air, they leave a ghostly afterimage in their wake.",,3
Cobbleswarm,Busy road builders might unknowingly use cobble mites in construction.,Cobble Mite,2
Cockatrice,"Ugly and aggressive, the dread cockatrice stalks garbage pits and hillside dumps in search of prey that it can turn to stone with its petrifying beak and subsequently consume piece by broken piece. Cockatrices resemble gaunt and sickly roosters with bat wings and serpentine tails, and they rarely grow more than 2 feet tall and twice as long. Their absentminded clucking gives smart prey ample warning of their presence, and when angered cockatrices let out a shrill crow like that of a rooster. Their peck releases a magical toxin that causes flesh to quickly calcify, and any creature pecked repeatedly by an irritable cockatrice eventually transforms into a stone statue of itself. The first cockatrice is rumored to have hatched from a rooster’s egg incubated on a dung hill by a toad. Whether or not the rumor is true, the cockatrice’s monstrous appearance certainly doesn’t contradict its strange and filthy origin story, and these creatures are more than capable of propagating on their own. Cockatrices are remarkably fecund and gather in flocks of up to a dozen members. Each flock contains only a few females. The males—which differ in appearance from the females by having warty wattles and gnarled combs— often fight with each other, with lower-ranking males eventually driven away to find their own lairs or compete among other flocks. Most creatures who run afoul of a solitary cockatrice do so with one of these surly outcasts. Cockatrice lairs are often littered with fragments of statuary from past victims—although these are as likely to be remnants of frogs, lizards, and insects as people. Curiously, weasels and ferrets, who infiltrate cockatrice lairs to steal their eggs, are immune to the creatures’ petrifying bites. For unknown reasons, cockatrices are both terrified of and enraged by conventional roosters, and they are equally likely to flee or attack when confronted by one. Particularly brave (or foolhardy) individuals sometimes keep cockatrices as pets or guard animals. In their natural habitat among plains, forests, and sewers near humanoid settlements, cockatrices are content to live off vermin or scraps of waste, but their greatest pleasure is consuming warm meals of freshly petrified flesh.",,3
Cockroach Swarm,"While cockroaches tend to gather in cramped spaces, a disturbed colony is sometimes prone to swarming, where hundreds or even thousands of the insects scurry out of their hiding places in a raft of shiny brown and black carapaces on thousands of skittering legs. Given how disgusting many find cockroaches to be, encountering such a swarm can be alarming to even the most seasoned adventurers. The creatures are relentless when disturbed; in contrast to the insects' normally skittish and harmless nature, as swarms they pursue the creature or creatures that provoked them and harry them with thousands of stinging bites.",Cockroach,2
Coil Spy,"Some serpentfolk undergo intense ritual training and practice to improve their innate ability to disguise themselves. These serpentfolk often identify as members of a sinister society known as the Coils of Ydersius, and the most devoted of their number seek out methods of reincarnating into new forms to even more efficiently infiltrate enemy societies. But before such agents take this extreme step, they must prove themselves as Coil spies. These serpentfolk train in methods of infiltrating other societies to such an extent that they might be capable of infiltrating a mammalian civilization for years. Though they're expected to work entirely toward the eventual triumph of their people, most Coil spies also find personal pursuits to keep them occupied in the shorter term. When Coil spies get caught, it's rarely due to a lack of pure skill, but rather to their arrogance or recklessness as they pursue their hedonistic desires.",Serpentfolk,4
Coldmire Pond,"Coldmire ponds are often mistaken for shallow pools of water, but these sentient bodies of living water actually crawl along the ground or float through other liquids. Coldmires are dangerous ambush predators, drowning creatures that stray too close to or, even more hazardously, stand or swim inside their waters.","Elemental, Water",8
Combusted,"Creatures whose lives end in flames can return as undead called combusted. Still burning even in death, they're consumed by everlasting anguish that drives them to reckless violence. Although combusted can no longer be truly harmed by fire, they endure the final moments of their death eternally, searing them with endless burning pain. Many combusted attempt to douse themselves in lakes or rivers, believing the flames that wreath their forms must be the source of their pain. However, water is more hindrance than help, and being immersed in it only amplifies their agony. No longer possessing the ability to communicate in anything other than agonized wails, combusted nonetheless retain their senses and memories. Yet they rarely seek to act on their past, for the pain drowns out thoughts of friendships, family, and vengeance. In time, combusted are driven to share their pain with others, for the instant their flames catch fire on another living being, they feel a single, fleeting moment of relief. This relief leads combusted into conflict with living creatures often, although those that attack large settlements rarely survive long. Some combusted form from those who died via spontaneous combustion, suddenly becoming so hot they burst into flames. This mysterious process isn't fully understood, though some scholars attribute it to shifts in power in the Plane of Fire causing hot spots in the Material Plane powerful enough to kill. Much more rarely, combusted arise around areas with especially intense magical flames, such as forges used to create magic weapons, when the fire sets creatures ablaze, so they burn to death and transcend into undeath in mere moments. Regardless of the source of their conflagration, the horrifying deaths that combusted suffered haunt them in the afterlife. Their charred, blackened corpses alight with flames are a constant reminder of their final moments in pain. The stench of burning flesh heralds their presence, each combusted leaving black smoke in their wake.",,3
Common Eurypterid,"The smallest of the giant eurypterids can grow to about the size of a large dog. These eurypterids are a staple food for people living in marshlands, who add the meat to heavily spiced stews, but they're otherwise considered dangerous pests.",Eurypterid,-1
Commoner,"Though not every commoner is downtrodden, many live hard lives of toil as they work to keep their families fed and housed in relative comfort. While many commoners are just simple folks who keep to themselves, sometimes commoners rebel, either rising up to face their oppressors or persuaded or even duped into joining nefarious plans and criminal conspiracies. Commoners benefit from power in numbers, and a crowd of commoners can accomplish a great deal more than their rulers often expect.",Downtrodden,-1
Comozant Wyrd,"Buzzing, crackling plasma makes up a comozant wyrd, electrically charged waves of greens, blues, and purples cascading in heatless flame. Given a mind and a semblance of a face, comozant wyrds need a surface from which they can crackle and writhe. Once secure, they seek out companionship from anyone nearby. In the Universe, they can be found in many places: lashing themselves to sailing ships, dancing across the buildings, or anchoring to the stones of a mountain range. In the vast spans of the Plane of Air, however, comozant wyrds often come to feel extremely lonely. A lucky few become pets for jaathooms living in the plane's cities, but many wait on isolated floating islands for an airship they can attach to or, more tragically, strive vainly to reach a distant shore before sputtering out.",,5
Compsognathus,"The compsognathus is a small bipedal dinosaur that moves in swift, darting motions. Its bite injects a venom that causes numbness and weakness, a trait that the animal uses to bring down larger prey, although it prefers to scavenge food or snatch up insects and other smaller creatures for its meals. The compsognathus is curious to a fault; most encounters that result in combat with these diminutive dinosaurs result not from the creatures' hunger but from frightened defensive reactions when the dinosaurs' inquisitive natures compel them to enter into situations (such as wagons or bedrolls) that inadvertently put them at odds with surprised adventurers.A compsognathus measures 3 feet long from its head to the tip of its tail and weighs 15 pounds. It is small enough to serve as a house pet or even as a familiar for a spellcaster. In cases where magical links aren't involved, however, those encountering or keeping the creatures would be well-advised to treat them with the same caution one might extend to a pet viper or other poisonous reptile, as they are at best partly tame.",Dinosaur,-1
Consonite Choir,"Floods of crystalline blades called consonite choirs surge through the caverns and tunnels of the Plane of Earth. Although their resonant chimes can be among the most beautiful music in the planes, those who intrude on their territory are instead confronted with a bone-shaking wall of sound and a barrage of razor-sharp crystals. The blades form naturally, just one of the many wondrous types of crystal on the Plane of Earth. Razor-edged consonite stalactites hum and chime along with the plane's grinding movement. As large collections of these crystals begin to communicate with each other through their shared song, they awaken into a sort of musical collective. Eventually, consonite choirs' songs grow loud and complex enough to shake these colonies loose of their stone moorings and free them to explore the Plane of Earth. Consonite choirs typically prefer to stay near their spawning grounds but might be coerced to perform in the homes of wealthy shaitans or serve other powerful creatures of earth. They willingly leave the comfort of their homes to hunt down the hated xorns, who enjoy the flavor of their immobile consonite brethren. Consonite choirs who leave the Plane of Earth, either through natural portals or by answering the calls of powerful rituals, often find the open spaces of other planes more to their liking. They enjoy the sensation of high winds moving through their chimes and search tirelessly for skilled performance partners. Crueler fates trap other choirs—more powerful beings might mystically bind them to service or bully them into becoming living trophies. Over years of movement, the individual crystal blades of a choir naturally chip and break down. In their native caverns, consonite choirs can easily find new members. Trapped elsewhere, they must rely on others for replacement blades or eventually fall into torpor.",,13

Coral Capuchin,"A coral capuchin resembles a hairless pink monkey with large eyes and batlike wings. Something of a tropical nuisance, these amphibious creatures follow trade ships, hoping to filch small valuables they can take home or perhaps find a sailor they can befriend to secure a regular supply of food. Coral capuchins live in tropical climates, and while they can breathe water or air with equal ease, their membranous skin means they rely heavily on having a nearby source of water. Fresh- and saltwater serve equally well for this purpose, though the creatures generally congregate near oceans and seas for other reasons. Jungles, islands, and warm coastlines are their most common nesting sites, though they usually hide their nests high in trees or in other locations out of easy reach of predators, scavengers, or anything that might steal the trinkets they've collected. These little flyers are insatiably curious, and they love to follow humanoids around. Capuchins largely agree that humanoids have the best food and trinkets. Smarter than animals and capable of rudimentary speech, the creatures can be quite useful with the right training, learning how seek out sunken treasures or hunt down rats and other pests on a ship. Some spellcasters residing along tropical coastlines have taken coral capuchins as familiars, though many claim the critters as far more trouble than any benefits they provide are worth. A capuchin familiar might pilfer spellcasting components, gemstones, vials, crafting materials, and other trinkets from their master, though a clever magic user will intersperse more appealing (and less valuable) baubles to draw their familiar's attention away from actually important items. Capuchin clans live together under a single matriarch, a slightly larger female who can be identified by her unusually prismatic skin and colorful eyes. These females refuse to be tamed or kept as pets and violently resist all forms of capture. The most powerful among them even possess divine powers which they call upon to protect their homes and kin. In return, the remainder of the clan fights fiercely to protect their matriarch, defending her (and her trinkets) from threats far larger than themselves.",,1
Cornugon,"Hell's armies contain legions upon legions of different devils all suited precisely to their roles. But such an army needs able commanders, and it is this role that cornugons fill. Their mere presence inspires those under their command to improved performance— often through fear of the horrible torments that a cornugon can unleash as punishment for failure. Forged in the fires of Malebolge from the most renowned warriors among lesser devilkind, even the least cornugon is among the fiercest warriors of the multiverse. The greatest among them on occasion ascend further still, becoming those rare and feared legends of Hell called malebranche.",Devil,16
Corpselight,"A will-o'-wisp that starves to death might rise as a cold, blue, glowing sphere of spongy wetness—a corpselight. A corpselight instinctively seeks out a host corpse to dwell within, as its physical form quickly deteriorates if not hidden within a dead creature.",Wisp,2
Corpseroot,"Corpseroots are rotten, undead trees that grow bright-red poisonous fruit and spread blight to surrounding plants, transforming healthy trees into new corpseroots. These cunning killers drain the life from creatures through their root systems, posing as dead trees until their victims come within reach. Corpseroots most commonly form from rotten husks of trees that died from supernatural blights, making them common threats in the Fangwood and Fierani forests. The most powerful are ancient trees used as shrines and sacrificial altars, their roots absorbing the blood, flesh, and terror of those condemned under their boughs. Some of these ancient corpseroots still command the respect and devotion of the cults that inadvertently created them.",,11
Corrupted Relic,"Creatures that once held particular items dear can be bound to them after death, their souls inhabiting the item from within. These might be the faithful haunting symbols of their faith, warriors clinging to their old weapons, or the greedy inhabiting their precious wealth. These spirits' physical bodies have long since degraded, but they keep their corrupted relics pristine. The spirits manifest on the unsuspecting or curious, determined to destroy anyone who would dare show any interest in their one precious possession. Though rare, there are several kinds of corrupted relics. The bound spirit can manifest in different ways, from animating an ancient weapon to possessing anyone who dons the item. Destroying the relic often ends up being the simplest, most direct way to banish the haunt itself. Destroying or dispelling the spirit without destroying the relic, however, can sometimes leave priceless treasure behind. The amulet shown here has the air and death aspects. Its minor gifts, deadly spark and death gaze, power some of the spirit's abilities. Someone who claims the relic might gain different gifts from those aspects.",,4
Counteflora,"The counteflora resembles an oversized dandelion with black flowers and sinister patterns on its bracts, which it can contract for additional protection and to turn its flower head into a deadly bashing weapon. Unlike dandelions, countefloras do not have separate flowering and seeding stages, and can release their intoxicating seedpods as long as their bracts are open. Countefloras exhibit a strange intellect and communicate with one another by releasing invisible pheromones into the air. Alone, a desperate counteflora may ally with another creature if it is offered water or fertile soil. Contrary to popular belief, countefloras absorb sunlight for sustenance; they do not attack other creatures to feast upon them. Rather, the reason countefloras go to such lengths to kill their opponents is to fertilize the surrounding soil and create a nutrient-rich environment for their seedpods.",,10
Crag Linnorm,"Despite being among the weakest linnorms, the crag linnorm is a devastating predator, capable of quickly cooking its foes with its magma breath.",Linnorm,14
Cranium Preserver,"Cranium preservers serve necromancers as walking laboratories for undead.

Crawling Slurry,"Acid damage can scar stone and reduce flesh to pitted chunks, but some organic compounds are resistant to acid and respond by combining into a mass of roiling, living slurry. These scarred clumps hunger to consume anything they can sense. They move with quick, darting contractions that surprise those used to facing slow-moving oozes.",Ooze,16
Creeping Crone,"Hags are neither immortal nor unageing; if not slain by an enemy, a hag eventually succumbs to old age. A hag who dies in agony or rage can rise again as a witchfire, while those who die of old age might rise again as an undead creature known as a creeping crone. A creeping crone has lost far more than her life; they can't form or join covens, denying them one of a living hag's most distinguishing abilities. This inability, more than their rotting bodies or hunger for flesh, makes creeping crones exiled among their former kin.",,11
Crimson Worm,"Among the most dangerous cave worms are the fiery crimson worms. In addition to being even larger than azure or purple worms, the crimson worm has a penchant for burrowing through volcanic regions that, over the generations, have infused it with a supernatural link to the Elemental Plane of Fire. The molten heart of an active volcano is an attractive lair for a crimson worm, as are the sprawling fields of bubbling magma found in the deepest reaches of the Darklands. Legends from ancient peoples, precursor dwarven societies, and colonists of the Elemental Planes populated moats of lava with crimson worms likely have some basis in truth, although the methods such ancients used to keep these “moat worms” contained and prevented them from chewing their way through fortress foundations must have been significant. Crimson worms sometimes frequent areas on the surface where volcanism creates hot springs or other geothermal features, but even then they prefer to spend most of their time burrowing through the ground in their never-ending search for sustenance. Surface lands claimed by crimson worms are notable for the mound-shaped burrows these creatures leave behind as they dig.",Cave Worm,18
Crocodile,"Crocodiles can be found basking on riverbanks, lurking in swamps, or floating in lakes. They are usually are indistinguishable from logs when viewed from afar—at least until they attack. Alligators have similar statistics, but because they often live in more temperate climates, they endure cold temperatures better. Unlike alligators, crocodiles can tolerate salt water. Both are formidable predators that are likely to devour careless adventurers who fail to watch where they step.",Crocodile,2
Crossroads Guardian,"When a village is threatened by a horde of bandits but there's no one to help, when a monastery's divine relic must be guarded but the last monk is on their deathbed, when the world can be saved only through the use of an artifact no one alive remembers, nature responds by creating a crossroads guardian, a naturally occurring entity of primal magic. Every crossroads guardian exists to satisfy a particular need—usually a quest that must be carried out, helpless individuals who must be saved from harm, or an object or location which must be guarded. Although they often appear at actual crossroads, a crossroads guardian can materialize anywhere there is a community, from a giant metropolis to a lizardfolk village in a remote swamp. Some crossroads guardians are martial beings—defending a mystic fountain against all intruders, for example—but most are helpers and assistants, guiding heroes through the wilderness to where they're needed. A guardian is a skilled warrior and can defend a location, but when its purpose involves a quest, or the need is so great that the guardian isn't up to the task alone, the guardian must persuade others to voluntarily accept their quest. Once a crossroads guardian has fulfilled its purpose, it either shifts to satisfy a new need or quest—often changing its alignment and abilities as well—or else slowly vanishes, returning to the raw primal magic from which it was formed.",,7
Crownbound Constellation,"Crownbound constellations are the essence of stars granted sentience by the goddess Desna, who created them to survey the vastness of space and help her craft the galaxy. Their intergalactic travels once took them far, but Lamashtu sought to ensnare Desna's creation. The Mother of Beasts lured them to Golarion and then, exploiting the power of Golarion's sun, corrupted their ability to star travel. Stranded on the planet and unable to bear sunlight, these creatures traveled to the Crown of the World, where they have settled ever since.",,8
Crucidaemon,"Of all the ways to die, crucidaemons represent perhaps one of the least desirable: death by torture. The fiend’s shapely body, which appears to be sculpted from iron or mithril, belies a sinister wrath and love of inflicting pain. Crucidaemons particularly enjoy inflicting pain with their curved, serrated daggers, which are attached to their bodies via a chain that pierces each wrist. A crucidaemon’s existence is dedicated to subjecting its prey to an eternity of pain and terror. Unlike other daemons, many of which are eager to feed on mortal souls as soon as they can, the crucidaemon takes much greater pleasure in prolonging the agony of its victims. Oftentimes, a crucidaemon will inflict such torment and pain upon its prey that when the end finally comes, the victim tearfully thanks the daemon for the mercy of oblivion. An encounter with a crucidaemon that does not end with its death is far from over—crucidaemons have unequaled patience for those who dare oppose them.
",Daemon,15
Crysmal,"Crysmals dwell within deep caverns of the Plane of Earth, laden with crystals that glow under their own internal energy. A crysmal's hunger for gems will lead it to travel almost anywhere, even through planar tears. Occasionally, they even establish colonies on planes other than their own, should their newfound territory prove filled with crystals. A crysmal's scorpion-like body glitters with crystal. As light refracts between the facets, they concentrate and absorb it, energizing the crysmal and, some say, fueling the creature's magic. Crysmals form small communities in locations where crystals are plentiful, working alongside one another to track down anything from a common quartz to precious rubies and sapphires. Scouting parties use their innate magic to communicate with each other via light and wordless sound, as well as to seek out more crystals. However, when precious stone resources grow scarce, crysmals become independent and territorial about their supply, taking crystals from wherever they can, even seizing them from other creatures. A crysmal's drive to gather crystals is akin to the drive to reproduce. As a crysmal gathers stones, it stores them within its body. Once the crysmal has enough stored material, the parent fuses its stores into a tiny replica of itself and extrudes the infant crysmal, sometimes referred to as a shardling, into the world. The process leaves the parent weakened for a short time, until it can gather enough crystal to repair its body and begin the process anew. Infant crysmals consume crystals in a similar way. They process the raw material over a few months to grow to adult size. Thereafter, a crysmal “eats” stone only to heal injuries.",,3
Crystal Strider,"Each long, thin leg of a crystal strider is a single enormous crystal, typically quartz or selenite. The strider uses this panoply of legs and a fluctuating physical structure to rapidly move about crystalline caverns, unimpeded by terrain.","Elemental, Earth",10
Cu Sith,"Cu siths are hound-like doorkeepers of remote portals to other planes, particularly portals to the untamed realm of the fey, the First World. They are highly territorial and roam the highland moors they call home, constantly on the hunt for any creatures that might intrude on their territory. Those that bargain for safe passage to or from a portal find cu siths to be vigilant escorts that keep travelers safe from extraplanar threats but also ensure their charges don’t veer from the most direct path to their destination. Cu siths are highly proficient hunters, and to mortals they offer a single warning in the form of their terrifying bark. Creatures that refuse to flee upon hearing a cu sith’s warning bark risk a quick and brutal death. Cu siths cut imposing figures; they are as large as bulls and covered in intertwining roots, plant matter, and shaggy green and white fur that terminates in a long, plaited tail. Their eyes glow with a fiery green light.",,7
Culdewen,"Perpetually cursed to hunger and failure, a culdewen plies waterways in search of appealing fish to catch—the bigger the better. Of course, this diminutive, emaciated fey calls every living creature a “fish.” Only other fey are exempt, and they tend to consider culdewens lost causes. A culdewen can never find satisfaction. Each time they catch a fish, a magical curse forces them to hunt for an appealing spot to dine—an island, cove, or abandoned dock or shack where they can eat in peace. By the time they arrive, their catch will be gone. Every time. Forever.A foul mood hovers over a culdewen, causing them to swear colorfully, smack things with their oar, and shake their tiny fists at the sky. Conversation with a culdewen is fruitless, as they talk in circles, speaking only of fishing and the weather. Capturing a “fish” gives a culdewen a rare moment of happiness; the culdewen capers and ululates, pleased with their catch, and rushes off to their boat.",,7

Cyclops,"The kingdoms of the cyclopes date to an age before the rise of humanity, when dragons and giants and serpentfolk ruled the world. The cyclopes built enormous stone cities and prayed to ancient gods of brutality and wrath, but their power to foresee the future failed them, and their civilization collapsed. Today, most cyclopes have virtually no knowledge of the former glory of their kind, even though it is not uncommon for them to dwell among the ruins of their greatness. Cyclops cities include monuments and imposing murals which depict their peoples’ history, but few now among them can read or interpret these relics of the past. In addition to their single eye, cyclopes are also famous for their never-ending hunger, an appetite so all-consuming that some scholars theorize it may in fact be some kind of curse. The ever-present hunger of the cyclopes seems to have some connection to the death of their civilization—though whether this voracity was the cause or a side-effect of their people’s downfall is likely destined to remain a mystery. Although details of the cyclopes’ gods have largely been lost to the annals of time, what little is known about these deities suggests they were vindictive and petty enough to curse their own people if they felt neglected or badly served.",Cyclops,5
Cythnigot,"The cythnigot is a foul fungal parasite that grows and thrives in the corpses of small creatures. It wears these bodies like a suit, but also adjusts and tailors the fleshy covering to suit its needs, and the body ends up looking as alien as anything else spawned from the Abyssal depths. The cythnigot's most identifying feature is the long stalk of fungal material that extends from creature's body, ending in a surprisingly strong set of fanged jaws.",Qlippoth,1
D'ziriak,"These strange creatures are native to the Plane of Shadows, where their colorful nature is in opposition to that realm's overwhelmingly monochromatic palette. Averaging 7 feet in height, D'ziriaks have four arms, two legs, and a termite-like abdomen. The larger pair of arms, used for most tasks, have five-fingered hands with sharp, insectile claws. The smaller pair of arms are reserved for fine manipulations and are not effective in combat.D'ziriaks' otherwise dull brown carapaces are decorated with numerous runes glowing in bright colors. These tattoo-like runes indicate an individual's role in D'ziriak society, and set them apart from their home plane's other native inhabitants. The runes glow with natural bioluminescence, and D'ziriaks can make them flare brightly for an instant, at the expense of overstressing the biochemical glands that create and maintain the runes for an extended time. The color and shape of the runes are partially natural, but can be shaped and customized carefully over time to fit the individual's station.The D'ziriak language is a mix of buzzes and chitters, and is spoken by few other creatures. D'ziriaks prefer to communicate with other species using telepathy rather than endure the sound of their language being ""butchered by fleshy throats."" D'ziriaks organize into hive cities led by a king and queen. These hive cities consist of impressive spires, yet these towers are only the foremost part of the settlement, with many more chambers reaching deep below for residences, workshops, and fungus farms. D'ziriak settlements are lit inside and out with alchemical and magical light sources, often in the shapes of runes. These dimly glowing towers provide travelers with landmarks, and perhaps promise safe havens, on the otherwise gloomy Shadow Plane.",,3
Daelum,"During the height of the legendary war between Nex and Geb, Nex's agents grew increasingly creative in their “recruiting” methods for their armies. One such effort involved the construction of mechanical soldiers powered by arcane engines but directed by transplanted minds. While the process generally involved willing donors who were eager to give up dying bodies to “live on” in constructed frames, rumors persist that Nex harvested the minds of prisoners of war and criminals for these creations. Today, thousands of years after those wars ended, hundreds of daelums still live. Their intellects have, in large part, fully embraced their new “lives,” and very few remember their previous existences today. Daelums can be found throughout the Mana Wastes serving as guides, porters, mine workers, and mercenaries.",,4
Daeodon,"Where the typical boar is merely ill-tempered and generally unfriendly, the towering daeodon is legitimately hateful and ruthlessly violent. Although omnivorous, the daeodon (known in some regions simply as a giant boar) prefers to feed on flesh. Primarily a scavenger, the daeodon isn’t adverse to attacking creatures it encounters while searching for easier meals, or to protect any perceived encroachment into its lair or feeding grounds. Particularly brave or skilled orcs are fond of using daeodons as mounts or war-trained battle beasts; orc cavalry mounted on daeodons is a fearsome force indeed. A typical adult daeodon is 10 feet long and 7 feet tall at the shoulder. It weighs approximately 2,000 pounds.",Boar,4
Dalos,"Dalos are reclusive fey that dwell within or near remote volcanoes and volcanic vents and resemble the massive calderas they call home. They more often dwell within the superheated confines of these locales than in the “cold wastelands” beyond their warmth and are therefore rarely encountered outside such environments. Like most fey, dalos are capricious and vengeful. They hate being disturbed above all else and will often warn away intruders with only the throw of a red-hot boulder before attacking outright. A dalos stands 25 feet tall and weighs in excess of 20,000 pounds.",,13
Damibwa,"Damibwas are domesticated hounds capable of detecting prey or predators via echolocation thanks to their exceptionally large ears and keen hearing. Adept swimmers, damibwas have sleek bodies, short limbs, webbed feet, and long muscular tails that enable them to maneuver underwater with grace and speed. Trained as specialized hunting hounds, damibwas primarily catch fish, although they're also adept at diving for lobsters, crabs, and clams. While hunting, damibwas wait near the water's edge, typically on a boat or along the shore, listening for choice prey. When they detect prey in range, they dive down below the water, catch the animal in their jaws, and drag it back up to the surface. When large or dangerous aquatic predators approach, damibwas retreat to land and howl a warning, making them desirable guard dogs in coastal or riverside communities. Damibwas rarely attack terrestrial creatures unless they're threatened and unable to make an escape. Damibwas are popular pets along rivers, lakes, and swamps throughout Golarion, particularly in the River Kingdoms, Wanshou, and the canals of Nantambu in the Mwangi Expanse. Some Erutaki in Avistan's far north hunt seals alongside a particular hardy breed covered in thick fur and a layer of blubber. They are only universally called damibwas in the Mwangi Expanse, and are often called “diving dogs” in other regions.",,4
Danava Titan,"Danava titans once regulated the foundational forces that shaped reality. Rebuked by the gods for being harsh and inflexible overseers, these spurned titans joined their siblings in their failed war against their creators. Defeated, the danavas were cast into the paralyzing depths of the cosmos's seas. The few danava titans who have escaped now wield the cold, darkness, and crushing pressure of their prisons in pursuit of their ancient visions of reality. Danavas split mountains, wake primordial beasts, or level whole civilizations in accordance with grand designs they forged at the dawn of time. Others hunt and harvest the balance-enforcing aeons, who they see as usurpers of their divine responsibility.",Titan,23

Dandasuka,"Known as “biters” among the more powerful rakshasa castes, dandasukas serve as spies and assassins for rakshasa clans or powerful spellcasters who have found methods to bind one of these fiends to their will. Born to manipulate and murder, these half-sized terrors revel in their work and delight in the sight of blood. They often dress in extravagant clothes dyed with ostentatious colors and wear numerous elaborate accessories, whether in their true form or in disguise as human children, halfling merchants, or anything else that helps them blend into their targeted society. A dandasuka rakshasa is constantly haunted by a monstrous hunger that gnaws at its hyperactive body, forcing it to feed often. In combat, a dandasuka might pause to lick a bloody blade or lap at a pool of spilled blood on the floor. These creatures settle for other meat when they must, but much prefer the taste of mortal humanoid flesh. Regular offers of such victuals can keep a dandasuka loyal to anyone willing to provide frequent meals, but care must be taken in keeping a dandasuka, for many stories tell of them being overly eager to serve an adored benefactor, taking off-hand remarks too literally, and performing services of violence that were never intended.",Rakshasa,5
Daqqanoenyent,"A daqqanoenyent is a horrific monstrosity arising from a terrible crime against the dead, obsessed with exacting retribution. The creature manifests as an enormous, disembodied head, 10 feet in height and covered in coarse black hair, with bat-like wings and vicious fangs and talons. Daqqanoenyents are naturally conflicted creatures. As the product of the tortured wills of numerous victims, daqqanoenyents sometimes exhibit strange or contradictory behavior as various individual wills struggle for control. Their conflicting desires make daqqanoenyents relatively easy to trick or deceive, and the creatures are vulnerable to fire. One story of a daqqanoenyent encounter describes the creature attempting to eat an old woman, only to be tricked by the woman into devouring a live coal. Their mouth aflame, the daqqanoenyent fled into the wilderness, never to be seen again.",Beheaded,9
Dark Naga,"Dark nagas are wicked, jealous creatures that crave power and wealth. Indeed, the dark naga sees such ideals as spiritual expressions of an essential truth: if one can take something, that something is theirs to have. The dark naga sees other creatures as lessers worthy only of subjugation or as rivals who must be eliminated. Dark nagas dwell in remote places other creatures have forsaken, searching abandoned ruins for wealth and potent magic items. Those unlucky trespassers into a dark naga’s lair typically find themselves as the naga’s slaves or playthings, put to sleep with the monster’s poison or incinerated by its deadly magic. Some dark nagas are more disposed toward socializing than others; in these cases, they may become wicked despots who rule over enclaves of captive or unsuspecting subjects. Subtler dark nagas, especially those who crave finer luxuries, dwell in or under the wealthy settlements and use their wiles to garner a decadent following, forming something akin to a cult with the naga as the jewelry-bedecked object of worship.",Naga,7
Deadly Mantis,These gigantic mantids make their homes within deep jungles and prehistoric forests where they hunt and devour equally massive prey.,"Mantis, Giant",11
Death Coach,"Roads are liminal spaces, existing to connect people and places but rarely destinations in and of themselves. Some see them as avenues to profit. Roadside inns can be lucrative businesses between metropolitan areas, and even villains such as bandits can earn a living plying their larcenous trade on various highways. Occasionally, a road will gain a dire reputation from banditry, treacherous terrain, or a history of deadly accidents. Despite this notoriety, such roads often remain in use simply because they are an important artery of travel or alternative routes prove impractical. On such roads, those stained with the blood of travelers or flooded with fear and anger, do death coaches ride. A death coach is the spiritual manifestation of the dangers of travel. It appears as a faintly translucent wheeled carriage pulled by one or two ghostly mounts, usually in the dead of night on a lonely bit of road. The coach and the mounts are a single spirit and can never be separated. A death coach has no driver, and anyone able to peek past the thick curtains covering the carriage windows will find the vehicle empty… unless the death coach has recently collected a soul. A palpable aura of dread surrounds a death coach, its very presence a harbinger of what is to come. A creature that dies near a death coach might have their soul trapped within. Such unfortunates manifest as incorporeal likenesses of their former selves seated within the carriage, their faces showing no emotion. They seem unaware of their fate and fail to notice anyone outside the carriage. After a death coach collects a soul or two, it rides off into the darkness with its prizes. Over the next few hours, any souls trapped within simply fade into nothingness, consigned to oblivion. Some scholars believe the death coach feeds off the souls it collects to maintain its unlife, while others think the energy of those souls eventually coalesces into another death coach, though it never appears on the same road. No one knows for certain what causes a death coach to haunt a particular road, but once one begins killing travelers for their souls, the rumors soon reach nearby communities. Sometimes, the road is abandoned entirely, leaving the death coach without sustenance. If left alone for long enough, the negative energy infusing the area slowly dissipates until the road is safe to travel once more, but if even one group of misguided travelers looking for a shortcut heads down the weed-choked lane, the death coach rises from its torpor to forcefully transport these unwilling souls. If it succeeds, the cycle begins anew. Other times, the communities in the area can't afford to establish a new route (or are physically incapable of doing so, in the case of mountainous regions), and so must continue to use the haunted road. The locals often mark such roads with signs to warn outsiders of the dangers, but the surprisingly clever death coaches do their best to destroy such notices. Canny travelers passing through unknown areas at night should remain on the lookout for damaged or disturbed signs to ensure they don't heedlessly head into a death coach's domain. Destroying the death coach is the only way to render the road safe until such time as a new tragedy accumulates enough negative energy to create another death coach. Some might believe this incarnation to be the first death coach returning for vengeance, but in reality, it is an entirely different undead creature. A careful inspection (which is difficult to achieve) reveals minor differences between the two death coaches, perhaps reflecting more recent carriage designs, though the newer spirit is as hungry for souls as the old.",,14

Though they are completely sightless, deculis possess rudimentary nerves in their skulls that allow them to detect the presence of infrared light—information they use to locate potential food and threats. They are deadly hunters, thanks largely to their magical ability to manipulate the ebb and flow of shadows.

They are lean and muscular, and have two powerful legs and a long tail that helps them maintain balance. Although deinonychuses don’t use their dexterous clawed forelimbs to attack, the dinosaurs can use them to pull aside small barriers. Although some of these dinosaurs have scaly skin, most have thatches of vibrantly colored feathers as well. A deinonychus is about 6 feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds. However, larger deinonychuses exist. These creatures—which stand taller than a human—are called megaraptors.",Dinosaur,2

Demilich,"Demiliches are formed when a lich, through carelessness or by accident, loses its soul cage. As years pass, the lich's body crumbles to dust, leaving only the skull as the seat of its necromantic power. The lich enters a sort of torpor, its mind left wandering the planes in search of ever greater mysteries. The lich gradually loses the ability to cast spells and its magic items slowly subsume into its new form. Negative energy concentrates around the skull, causing some of its bones and teeth to petrify with power and turn into blight crystals. The resulting lich skull, embedded with arcane gemstones and suffused with palpably powerful magic, forms a creature called a demilich. Despite its near-constant state of inactivity, a demilich grows restless from time to time, especially when living creatures draw near. Only then does the demilich's hunger for life stir once more, causing it to lash out with terrifying bursts of power in attempts to consume vital energy. Unlike an ordinary lich, should the demilich's skull be destroyed, its bond to the world is permanently severed, although some theorize that even then it is not truly slain. Rather, some think that once the demilich is destroyed, its foul and tormented mind is finally free to wander the planes and find new ways to enact its will. For the short-lived common folk of the Material Plane, this is good enough, though eons later a demilich may reappear in the region it once inhabited with a new—and even more insidious—agenda.",Lich,15
Demonic Rabble,"The typical demon throng consists of a chaotic mix of less powerful demons— typically abrikandilus, dretches, and quasits, with a few brimoraks, babaus or other, more powerful demons swept up in the mayhem.

While the inscrutable denizens dress themselves in flowing robes, veils, and broad turbans to appear human, their aberrant physiology, when glimpsed, is evident from their crown of stubby horns and tentacled jaws to their furry, goat-like legs.Above the fierce captains who command the infamous black ships are an even higher caste of denizens of Leng. These cultists and musicians serve as high priests, laboring to appease the frightening gods who look down upon the Nightmare Realm with cold malice.",,8
Derghodaemon,"Derghodaemons represent death through unfathomable violence and being eaten alive. Whether in life a ravenous murderer hacked them to bits for stew, a werewolf tore them limb from limb, or they simply succumbed to the elements and became worm meat, derghodaemons seek to inflict the same twisted and bloody ends upon any they come across. Unlike some daemons, derghodaemons derive little pleasure from prolonged deaths—to these fiends, the quicker they can enact a gory demise, the sooner they can turn their attentions to their next victim and repeat the violent cycle.Derghodaemons look like walking masses of razor-sharp insect claws connected to equally menacing chitinous limbs, but few linger on their appearance for long— the gaze of a derghodaemon is enough to cause others in the vicinity to experience severe visual warping. The derghodaemon's appearance becomes more and more twisted as those who stare at it experience vicious hallucinations and ravenous urges to inflict harm on and devour others. Perhaps the most horrific attack derghodaemons can unleash upon their victims, though, is their swarming infestation—the daemons cough up a crawling, buzzing cloud of ravenous insects that cling to those targeted and chew them to death, provided the mind-numbing, half-whispered threats made by the rasp of the insects' bodies don't drive them to violent fury first!",Daemon,12
Derhii,"Legend suggests that Shory mages might have created derhiis as soldiers. Although folklore can be in error, little doubt exists that these flying apes make excellent warriors. History is also clear that derhiis fought countless battles for the Shory Empire, honing their tactical skills and martial traditions. Regardless of whether Shory magic was responsible for the birth of the first derhiis, lore passed down from those times shows the Shory Empire honored their soldiers and treated them as valued allies rather than mere servants. Derhiis are scarce even in the Mwangi Expanse, where the last of the Shory flying cities, such as Kho and Ulduvai, fell. Still, some dwell among the spires that tower above Shory ruins; these derhii are often quite a bit more powerful than the one detailed below. Other derhiis have spread from the remains of the fallen Shory empire to populate remote highlands and old-growth forests. Derhiis form small filial groups called troops, centered on one elder derhii and their relations. Several troops might gather into a larger society with a council of troop leaders under one dominant elder. Derhiis are omnivores who favor meat, unlike the terrestrial and largely herbivorous gorillas they resemble. It's possible that this habit developed due to a derhii need for substantial amounts of food coupled with their soldierly ways.",,5

Desa-Desa,"Also known as “bubble cats” or “gas cats,” desa-desas are small, vaguely feline predators that hunt the jungles of Castrovel. A typical desa-desa is roughly the size and shape of a bobcat. Its head is reptilian, sporting large eyes and slender fangs that protrude from its lips. Desa-desa fur tends to match their environment—most are dark green and brown—and is punctuated by patterns of small, bubble-like bladders that protrude from the creature's skin like transparent boils. Every desa-desa has a different bladder pattern, and this distinctive anatomical feature is key to the creature's survival. Desa-desas' lives revolve around a little-understood (and likely magical) process by which the creatures transform water into its constituent gaseous elements. A desa-desa stores these gasses in the polyp-like bladders, which are lined with an electricity-conducting material that allows the creature to create sudden blasts of flame in all directions. As a predator, the desa-desa's most dangerous attack is its bite, which passes along its bubble venom, which can ravage the fluids in the victim's own body. This reaction causes water in the target's cells to split rapidly, creating bubbles of gas that percolate through the creature's flesh to its skin, where it balloons outward in large, agonizing blisters before popping. The combustible gasses in these blisters also make a creature particularly susceptible to fire attacks—such as the desa-desa's defensive blast. A typical desa-desa is 4 feet long counting the tail, and weighs just 30 pounds.",,2

Desert Drake,"Distant cousins of blue dragons that lack their relatives’ magical talents and intelligence, these desert-dwelling drakes are nonetheless dangerous ambush predators, preying upon isolated desert travelers and outposts for food and supplies. They retain their true-blooded forebears’ resistance to electricity and affinity for sandy environs. Desert drakes’ scales range in coloration from rust-brown to light tan and ocher shades, mimicking the colors of the dunes they call home. Desert drakes are among the lightest and most compact of the drakes, though this shouldn’t be mistaken for frailty. Their swooped-back horns and feather-thin wings are adapted to make burrowing as easy as possible. Indeed, a desert drake’s powerful neck makes wriggling through sand and other loose scree as easy as walking for it.",Drake,8
Desert Giant,"Desert giants are nomadic humanoids who have dwelled in the world's most arid regions since time immemorial. Smaller peoples know that desert giants are the undisputed masters of desert living, and ignorant humans often claim that it is a desert giant's unique physiology, like a camel, that enables them to survive without water for 2 weeks. The few desert giants who mingle in the societies of smaller humanoids don't bother to dispute such ridiculous rumors. In fact, desert giants' strong cultural traditions play a large part in their ability to prosper in such harsh environs. Desert giant elders encourage their descendants to maintain abstemious lifestyles, particularly with regard to the consumption of food and drink. Alcohol is particularly disdained by desert giants, who view mind-altering diuretics like liquor and ale as dangerous temptations in an environment as unforgiving as the desert. Instead, most desert giants follow a simple vegetarian diet and maintain an incredible internal map of their home region's seasonal waterways and oases. Their austere habits and intolerance for foolishness have earned desert giants a reputation as being ill-humored and no-nonsense, but many of their communities boast a wide variety of humorous tales in their vast oral histories and legends. Since desert giants' journeys across the wastes can span weeks or even months at a time, an individual who can make their companions laugh with a witty joke or amusing parable remains a prized member of the community. Desert giants stand 15 feet tall, tending toward lean physiques that are ideal for traveling across vast expanses of sand for long sojourns.",Giant,9

Destrachan,"This underground reptilian horror walks on two powerful hind legs. Its forelimbs are armed with sharp curving claws, and its toothy, eyeless, tubular head has three hypersensitive frilled ears that turn toward any sound made in its vicinity. This cruel monster's true weapon, however, is an amplified version of the sonic cry that it uses to navigate, communicate, and hunt. It communicates with others of its kind through a complex series of clicks, shrieks, and whistles, but it is intelligent enough to understand other languages. Most destrachans understand at least one other language—usually Undercommon—and can often be reasoned with.An obligate carnivore, the destrachan relishes fresh meat but won't hesitate to make a meal of carrion it finds in its path. When traveling in packs, the creatures take great delight in stalking travelers through miles of tunnels before attacking and subduing them, then devouring them alive.",,8
Devourer,"When fiends and powerful evil spellcasters are lost beyond the farthest reaches of the multiverse, they sometimes return as horrific undead called devourers that consume the souls of the living to fuel their arcane machinations. Their bodies are ruined and rebuilt, hollow and twisted, even as their minds undergo a spiritual transformation. They gain the ability to bind other souls to their own and drain their essence for magical power, yet can never be sated in their pursuit of it. Seething masses of distorted ghostly shapes surge within their hollow rib cages—manifestations of the devourers' most recently consumed souls.",,11
Dewdrop Jelly,"Dewdrop jellies are small water elementals resembling jellyfish made of gelatinous bubbles. They typically travel in small schools, floating through the air or swimming through the endless seas of their home plane. When threatened, the jellies discorporate into a thin, vaporous mist, reconstituting into their bubble shape only after the danger has passed. Their clever elusiveness makes them hard to find, leading some to claim that dewdrop jellies are mythical flights of fancy told to entertain children.","Elemental, Water",1
Dezullon,"Dezullons are dangerous carnivorous pitcher plants that dwell in forested regions with thick canopies. They hunt for meat along the forest’s understory when not sunning themselves in the boughs above. Dezullons are smart enough to notice that some creatures are attracted by shiny things, and sometimes use such objects to set up ambushes. To assume that the dezullon’s ambulations are slow simply because the creature has a root structure is a foolish mistake; many an adventurer has been crushed to death by this surprisingly agile plant. In addition, these dangerous plants are expert climbers, making their pursuit even more difficult to escape from. A hungry dezullon keeps prey off-balance by spilling its putrid, psychoactive digestive juices from its central pitcher. In addition to being highly acidic, the enzymes in a dezullon’s digestive tract, once expelled, inflict a victim with powerful hallucinations and amnesia. This secondary effect makes dezullons highly sought after in some circles, including avid drug users, experimental doctors, and criminals who deal in poisons. Many varieties of dezullon exist, including lumbering giants of incredible size, those that have tiny, cup-shaped pitchers that proliferate along lengths of creeping ivy like suckers on a squid’s tentacles, and others with hundreds of blood-red, razor-sharp leaves that protrude from the inside of their pitchers like a leech’s teeth. This latter variety is especially dangerous, since the leaves can all but eviscerate creatures that become ensconced inside their pitchers.",,10

Dig-Widget,"Thieves covet dig-widgets, specialized constructs built for infiltration. Each dig-widget contains numerous simple tools, including a set of mechanical devices that function as thieves' tools, two arms with drills, and two arms with corkscrews for attaching to and climbing surfaces. Once activated, these devices propel themselves forward. Though they have the full faculties typical of a construct, they usually follow a simple routine: avoid notice, pick any lock barring the path, dig past obstacles, and attack if caught. They're rarely left unattended, as a thief needs to be nearby to follow after-both to steal goods and to stop the dig-widget from engaging in further larceny once it's achieved its goal. The source of a dig-widget's power is as much mechanical as it is magical. The gears and springs that provide a dig-widget mobility are an improvement over more primitive true clockwork creations (whose functions require constant winding to remain mobile), but at the cost of security, for a dig-widget's moving parts can be dismantled quickly by thieves and others with the proper training.",,5

Dirge Piper,"Under rare circumstances, an attempt to reanimate a skilled musician or performer as a mindless zombie is impeded by lingering occult magic that anchors a piece of the being's artistic soul to its shambling body. The resulting dirge piper retains a fragment of the person's former intellect and personality, but lacks the coordination and acuity to make true music any longer. Instead, they force air through the cavities and organs of their decomposing bodies to produce haunting piping, squelches, and trumpeting. Most dirge pipers cling to a sense of fashion from their former lives, often obsessing over the condition of their clothes. They are aware enough of their deteriorating bodies that their own decay drives them into deepening despair. The only thing more disturbing to a dirge piper than their corpse is their own music. Despite hating the sounds they make, they cannot help but produce constant noise from their mouths and their wounds. Although many necromancers consider the noisy dirge pipers a mistake, dirge pipers can be useful as leaders of other groups of zombies because their piping invigorates their fellow walking corpses.

Doorwarden,"Doorwardens are constructs originally invented by elves. Upon first glance, these guardians resemble ornate doors made entirely of steel or even mithral, but when trespassers try to force their way past, the doorwarden transforms into a skilled and sturdy soldier bearing its “door” like a towering shield. Perceptive travelers can sometimes spot a door warden before its magic becomes obvious. The door often bears a round disk or similar embossment that resembles a shield boss designed for bashing, and the bar that can be lowered to block entry resembles an arm clasping a longsword by the hilt. The original doorwardens crafted by the elves included a motif of elven armor and a metal mask in the style of Alseta’s own, though other cultures embellish their own doorwardens with their own themes and sometimes even their own ancestral weapons, such as axes for dwarven doorwardens. Doorwardens sometimes know about the chambers they guard, and they have been known to speak to trespassers, especially elves. But a doorwarden cannot be persuaded to stand aside; it is bound to the portal where it has been placed and will defend it until destroyed.",,5
Doppelganger,"In their natural forms, doppelgangers are humanoid creatures with flesh of indeterminate color and features that lack fine details, as if unfinished. As masters of mimicry, they use their abilities to impersonate others in devious ways, often infiltrating settlements and residing within them for years without being detected. Doppelgangers are incredibly secretive, with some nearing outright paranoia. They choose their targets carefully and go to great lengths not to reveal their intentions before their plans come to fruition. Doppelgangers usually infiltrate communities in order to gain some manner of wealth or power, and assume the guises of other (usually influential) persons to allow the creatures they’re impersonating to take the fall for any negative consequences that may result from their actions. Though most are not evil, doppelgangers are manipulative and self-serving. As they don’t have their own society and aren’t monolithic in their motivations, an individual doppelganger has its own unique interests and impulses, though many are over-indulgent. Some doppelgangers enjoy the thrill of subtlety, while others favor grander schemes, such as manipulating a nation’s political infrastructure. Others seek to exploit merchant guilds to gain immense wealth, while others use their shape-changing ability to destroy relationships between close friends or families. Doppelgangers are careful and patient creatures. They are willing to slowly construct elaborate schemes that may require extended periods of time—even decades—to yield results. Doppelgangers often work alone, as they don’t trust potential cohorts not to ruin their plans. There are rare times when doppelgangers might reveal secrets to high-ranking individuals to ensure a successful infiltration. When they do work with others, it’s because they’ve taken the shape of a target group’s leader, unbeknownst to the organization’s members. Doppelgangers can grow in power by learning skills and abilities, and often make excellent rogues, spellcasters, or fighters. A doppelganger that has class abilities can often effectively infiltrate and plague an adventuring group as a powerful antagonist—but using a doppelganger like this in your game should be handled with care (see the Infiltrating a Party sidebar above for more information).",,3

On neutral ground, a doprillu offers to duel the strongest-looking opponent, but when a doprillu's home turf is invaded, no rules apply to the confrontation. As befits the superheated blood that fuels them, doprillus make their homes in warm locations: hot jungles, sunny deserts, and underground caverns near sulfur vents.",,14
Doru,"These deceivers whisper fetid lies, sowing dark and dread inspiration into foolish mortal ears. Dorus serve as the spies and messengers of the divs. With silver tongues and dark motives, they often pledge themselves to vainglorious and deluded spellcasters, who they ply with wild conspiracies and rumors of deception among friends and foes alike; in the process, they push supposed masters to despotism and murderous revenge. All the while, dorus wean secrets, and weaknesses, from their marks. In the end, nearly every doru turns on their false liege, destroying the reputation and even causing the death of the person the doru pretended to serve.",Div,1
Dracolisk,"Dracolisks are rare magical crossbreeds of chromatic dragons and basilisks. None now know how they first came to be, but they have proven viable and can breed with one another as well as with basilisks. While a dracolisk appears much like a young true dragon of its parent type, its eight legs are an immediate indication that it is something more. Its coloration varies, depending on the nature of its draconic ancestry, though it's lighter on its underside and darker near its wing tips. A typical dracolisk is 15 feet long and weighs 3,000 pounds.",Basilisk,9
Draconal,"Dragon agathions, known as draconals, number among the most powerful of their kin, and also the wisest, embodying the wisdom of the benevolent philosopher-king. With their wisdom comes an elevation above material matters, making them the most removed from the troubles and lives of mortals. Draconals serve as the guardians of powerful magic, and they dispense their wisdom in service of the greater good of Nirvana and the celestial planes. Draconals appear more draconic than humanoid. They walk on their hind legs and balance on their long, serpent like tails. Sharp claws tip their scaled humanoid hands. Similar to true dragons, a draconal's coloration signifies different breath weapons, traits, and resistances. Draconals also choose spells from one of four domains. All have the options of the air and healing domains, but their color determines the other two. Black draconals breathe and are resistant to fire, and their additional domain options are fire and luck. Red draconals have the same fire breath and resistance, but their additional domain options are protection and sun. Green and white draconals breathe and are resistant to cold, but green draconals have the options of nature and water domains while white draconals have the options of freedom and repose. Yellow draconals breathe and are resistant to acid, and their additional domain options are earth and luck.",Agathion,20
Dragon Turtle,"When sailors warn others of the terrible threats of the open sea, they seldom forget to mention dragon turtles—immense aquatic dragons with rocky shells similar to those of tortoises and flippers powerful enough to overturn hardy vessels. These fearsome creatures enjoy being considered as dangerous as storms or natural disasters by seafaring folk. Dragon turtles delight in amassing treasure, although most prefer to receive tribute from passing sailors and often store their hoards in the shipwrecks of vessels once crewed by those unwilling to surrender their valuables. Dragon turtles are solitary creatures and hunt in regions encompassing a hundred square miles or more. Although they normally eat large fish, they are omnivorous and also eat seaweed or even foolhardy dragon hunters. Experienced sailors keep a keen eye out for dragon turtles, preparing to flee should one approach or offer it treasure in exchange for safe passage. Most dragon turtles are at least 20 feet wide and 50 feet long, although some can grow substantially larger. These massive, ancient dragon turtles are somnolent, and resemble rocky islands from a distance; their prodigious hoards can be a source of truly ancient sea lore. Legends persist of truly immense dragon turtles who spend centuries drifting on the surface of the ocean, far from established shipping lanes or charted waters, with shells that serve as islands capable of supporting entire ecosystems and even, some claim, small settlements whose inhabitants know nothing of land that doesn’t drift across the sea.",,9
Dragon's Blood Puffball,"This bulbous, deep red fungus looks like an enormous, decaying rose.",Deadly Puffball,8
Dragonscarred Dead,"Not all would-be dragonslayers who die a valiant death rest peacefully amid the annals of legend. Sometimes, a draconic necromancer is so impressed by its fallen foe that the dragon ritually raises the dead warrior to serve the dragon in undeath. These undead guardians are infused with a fraction of the power of the dragon who slew them, channeling the same energy as their draconic masters’ breath. Dragonscarred dead are similar to skeletal champions or graveknights in that they are not merely reanimated servants who mindlessly follow orders, but are instead powerful wardens who maintain the same agency they bore in life. While a dragonscarred dead is often magically compelled to follow its reanimator’s commands, some of these undead dragonslayers manage to escape their masters and pursue their own vile agendas—which may involve rallying allies to challenge their draconic creator once more and finish the dire mission they started in life.",,13
Drainberry Bush,"Drainberry bushes are floating bushes that originate from the First World, with long, thorny vines and dense clusters of bright-red berries. Their hollow thorns quickly siphon blood, which is how these carnivorous plants feed, and they rapidly turn consumed blood into fresh batches of delicious berries. Drainberry bushes exude a faint white glow that is a result of stored positive energy.Drainberry bushes exhibit unusually high intelligence and have an astute sense of value. They typically become insulted when creatures attempt to harvest their berries. Creatures that attempt to converse with drainberry bushes finds the plants telepathically convey only short and simple phrases: most commonly, “Money please,” “Deal good,” “Deal no good,” “Want that,” (with a gesture toward an item it covets), “Thank you, customer,” and if necessary, “No refunds.” Though a drainberry bush considers the market value of its berries to be 25 gp, it greatly prefers interesting art objects as payment—even ones of significantly lower value.",,7
Drakauthix,"The drakauthix is a massive fungus that floats through the heights of the largest Darklands caverns, propelled by bladders that spray air and spores. A voracious but slow-moving hunter, the drakauthix prefers to ambush meaty creatures from above, using its hooked appendages to pull its victims upward to feed. The drakauthix’s digestive process is entirely external—it clings to victims, and its spore-laden surface slowly feeds on and grows through the flesh before the spore-infested carcass is discarded. As the infested body strikes the ground below, it bursts and releases a cloud of spores, unleashing a host of young called sporelings that immediately scuttle up the cavern walls to cling to its ceiling and grow. The drakauthix behaves no more intelligently than most predatory animals, and often uses a sort of symbiotic scavenger method to secure prey by capitalizing on the hunting methods of oozes and vermin found in the large cave systems it frequents. When a relatively mindless creature kills a victim, the drakauthix drifts down, hooks the freshly slain carcass with its tendrils, and reels in its meal. The mindless ooze or other creature that just had its food stolen rarely holds a grudge and simply slithers off to find a new quarry, letting the drakauthix digest the corpse in peace. Of course, the drakauthix isn’t above feasting on more active prey as well, and might attack an adventurer who neglects to look upward for danger when exploring a network of mysterious caves. Some Darklands-dwelling creatures, such as duergars, hunt drakauthixes for their flesh, which has a unique flavor with a peppery aftertaste. Subterranean races also make ink from drakauthixes by burning their carcasses, then grinding and pressing the ashes for a long time until a silvery substance congeals.",,9
Drake Skeleton,"Moving with sinuous grace, these flying drake skeletons are held aloft by rotting membranes stretched between their bony wings. Although just as mindless as other skeletons, skeletal drakes maintain much of the draconic ferocity and raw spite they possessed in life, allowing them to attack viciously.",Skeleton,8
Dramofir,"Beings of inscrutable intent and incredible power, dramofirs hail from the Dreamlands and shamble across the multiverse in search of dreams to incorporate into their voluminous robes. Few people on the Material Plane dare trifle with dramofirs and instead treat them with respect, hoping that they'll simply take their chosen victims' dreams and then go away. Often, this is exactly what happens. Every now and then, however, in the process of siphoning an individual's dreams, the dramofir slays their victim without warning or apparent cause.",,14
Draugr,"Risen corpses of sailors who died at sea, draugr reek of the rot and decay of the briny deep. Their eyes glow with ghastly green light, and rotting seaweed, barnacles, and dead sea creatures cling to their bodies. Draugr can't speak, but expresses their malicious emotions with gurgles, as though they were eternally drowning with lungs full of water. They desire little more than to attack living creatures, especially those who sail the sea. Even when they go upon land, draugrs often drag the corpses of those they strike down back to the water, populating the depths with even more dead.Draugr rise in the haunted places of the sea, where restless spirits, swells of negative energy, or supernatural storms deliver death. A corpse might rest at the bottom of the sea for some time before awakening as a draugr. Collecting detritus and organisms, a corpse becomes increasingly disgusting before it finally rises. Proximity to intelligent life can expedite this process, and an underwater explorer who happens upon a shipwreck might cause a body to snap to unlife as a draugr suddenly. The creatures don't take intrusions lightly, especially upon their place of death.Though steeped in evil, draugr are susceptible to reminders of their lives as mariners. In particular, a well-performed sea shanty or call-and-response work song might cause a draugr to become lost in reverie for a moment. The creatures have even been witnessed moaning along, unable to sing the words but providing haunting accompaniment. The lull rarely lasts long, though, as the beauty of the song quickly becomes a reminder of the tragedy that befell the draugr, reaffirming their desire for blood and death.More powerful draugr with burning red eyes are called draugr captains. They're 3rd-level creatures with elite adjustments that can cast obscuring mist as an innate divine spell three times per day.",,2
Draxie,"The mischievous dragon sprites known as draxies have dueled their pixie cousins for the title of ultimate prankster for centuries. Possessed of draconic features and brilliant colorations, draxies descend from a mighty faerie dragon, reincarnated into multiple draxies after her death in the mercurial fashion of the fey realm. Draxies exercise patience and planning to create the perfect pranks, spending months, or even years, on their efforts.",Sprite,3
Dread Dhuthorex,"More intelligent than their lesser kin, dread dhuthorexes possess eerie, enchanting powers.",Dhuthorex,11
Dread Wisp,"Will-o'-wisps native to the Darklands are more ominous and malevolent than those that bob about in the lonely marshes and surfaces of the upper world. These dread wisps instill terror with eerie shifts of light and consume the fear they create, drawing life energy from their victims in the process. While dread wisps can survive anywhere within the Darklands, they prefer moist areas like partially submerged caves, the banks of underground rivers, and towering fungus gardens. Dread wisps don't glow as brightly as surface will-o'-wisps because even the dimmest light attracts notice underground. Long-lived and hateful creatures, they remember vivid details about their lives, travels, and most delicious prey. Although dread wisps could share extensive lore and unique experiences, they don't, as they find amusement in others' ignorance.",Wisp,9
Dread Wraith,"These menacing spiritual remnants of wicked warlords or bloodthirsty generals are towering specters of shadow and death. Like other wraiths, dread wraiths haunt the shadowy places of the world, but dread wraiths are more likely to travel greater distances to sow terror or amass influence, often sticking to dark glades or sinister ruins when journeying across sun-dappled lands. Dread wraiths tends to be arrogant and rarely form a pack with others of their kind, preferring instead to dominate groups of ordinary wraiths. A particularly powerful necromancer might compel packs of dread wraiths into service, however, while a particularly malevolent goal—such as to eradicate a bastion of light and life—might draw several dread wraiths together in a common purpose.",Wraith,9
Dreadsong Dancer,"Dreadsong dancers are shaped from the souls of bards, dancers, and musicians who pledged themselves to Hell in exchange for enhanced artistic ability. Fiendish flesh-sculptors twist these forfeited souls so they cannot perform the art that drove them in life—sewing their mouths shut, mutilating their limbs, and grafting serrated scythe-like appendages called songblades. Devils send these warped creatures to torment artists who seem likely to break their infernal contracts, both to mete out punishment and, perversely, to give mortals a glimpse of the fate that awaits their damned souls.",,8
Dream Spider,"A dream spider's webs have an iridescent hue and are infused with the same hallucinogenic compound as the creature's toxin. Originally denizens of tropical jungles, dream spiders have adapted well to temperate environments, particularly thriving among the rooftops of cities where shady alchemists use their venom to produce the drug known as shiver.",Spider,0
Dreamscraper,"Dreamscrapers invade the dreams of sleeping mortals to scrape away at their minds and steal their dreams, leaving them raw and tired upon waking. Maggot-like, with many eyes surrounded by a circular, toothy mouth, dreamscrapers use sharp barbs attached to ethereal tendrils to trawl for dreams. After returning to the Dimension of Dreams with their prizes, they store them in their dark, spire-like cocoons, trade them, or offer them up to their heinous masters as some obscure tax. Although many dreamscrapers act as servants for more powerful creatures, some act independently. Unable to dream themselves, their fascination leads them to experiment with their collections. They attempt to either synthesize dreams of their own or implant collected dreams within themselves.",,7
Drenchdead,"When great heroes or other powerful individuals encounter misfortune and die at sea or to other water-related accidents, the anguished soul sometimes clings to its corpse, creating a drenchdead. Drenchdead prefer to lurk in water and attack from ambush, giving victims the same deadly surprise that led to their own deaths. A drenchdead can manipulate water to drown a victim directly but prefers to draw out this suffering.",,12
Dreshkan,"Because morlocks are descended from distant human ancestors, clumsily or hastily fleshwarping a morlock simply produces a grothlut. Skilled fleshwarpers, however, can tease out a morlock's genetic differences to make an entirely different creature. Creating a dreshkan involves replacing the morlock's bones with a metal skeleton. This new skeleton is often heavily augmented, such as with spiderlike limbs protruding from the spine or magazines of tiny, deadly needles. Arcane electricity courses through the dreshkan thereafter, making it jumpy and irritable. Morlocks view dreshkans as impressive fusions of flesh and technology and gladly fight alongside these creatures, whom they view as paragons of morlock potential.",Fleshwarp,4
Dretch,"Among the lowest and least powerful of all demons, dretches are just as vicious and cruel as their more powerful brethren. They happily vent their frustrations on anything weaker than themselves. Born from the souls of the slothful, these demons appear vaguely humanoid in appearance with awkward limbs and slack lumps of skin hanging from their frames. Supposedly, a single slothful soul of sufficient depravity and strength can spawn an entire horde of these creatures. However, as weaker demons, their lot in life is to suffer at the hands of more powerful Abyssal predators, and only a tiny number of dretches ever manage to become something more. For this reason, dretches are quite accommodating when summoned by mortals. They're usually content to work under conditions few other outsiders would accept, although they'll still gladly turn on even the kindest of masters who show even the slightest hint of weakness.",Demon,2
Drider,"The first fleshwarping process mastered by the drow remains both their most successful and most infamous: the drider. Fusing the body of a drow with that of a giant spider, driders are a sexually dimorphic fleshwarp—the only fleshwarp known to be able to produce young. While female driders have the upper torsos of elegant drow women with mouths featuring sharp poisoned fangs, male driders have hideous, mutated countenances that further blend the humanoid form with that of a spider; the difference in appearance is perhaps a reflection on the matriarchal nature of drow society. In combat, all driders are equally dangerous. Although the fleshwarping process was originally intended to be a punishment for drow who fell from grace, the significant powers and strengths gained from the horrifying transformation are attractive to some drow, and an increasing number of lower-ranking citizens in drow cities volunteer themselves for the painful procedure. In return for mandatory time (typically measured in decades) serving as a guardian, soldier, or other public servant, such volunteer driders are later allowed to lead their own lives, typically in caverns located in a city’s periphery. The painful truth is that for most driders, they do not live long enough to see this reward, for the drow have a penchant for working their fleshwarped slaves to death or deploying them in deadly war missions in which survival is a only a remote possibility. Most driders use arcane magic, but driders who use divine magic are well known, while a rare few use occult or primal magic. A drider’s innate spells remain the same regardless of the magical tradition, but those who use different types of magic as prepared spells may well have entirely different spells prepared than the drider presented below.",Fleshwarp,6
Dromornis,"Dromornises are large, flightless, carnivorous birds that travel in packs to ambush prey. Their short, stubby wings may give them a comical appearance, but anyone who's been on the receiving end of the beast's powerful beak finds the experience less than amusing. Dromornis use their beaks to easily tear flesh and sinew from prey's bones, quickly dispatching sizable mammals like deer, tapirs, and primates. Particularly hungry or aggressive dromornises have even been known to attack humanoids. The bird's strong legs sport sharp talons that, while secondary in combat to its beak, can nonetheless trample and shred smaller creatures like rodents and amphibians caught underfoot. While a lone dromornis is dangerous enough, a pack of dromornises can take down a den of bears or village of humanoids. A dromornis pack typically consists of three or four adults and up to five juveniles, all of whom work in tandem to overpower larger prey. Packs lie in wait for something like an anaconda, boar, buffalo or, in cases of desperation, a dinosaur to emerge, then move as one for a surprise strike. Dromornises aren't particularly intelligent, but they have been known to use an ingenious (if hazardous) decoy tactic, luring in massive prey by putting one of their own fledglings at risk. Dromornises most often live in tropical jungles far from the reaches of civilization, though they sometimes make their homes in mountainside caves or along rocky coastlines. While most onlookers would be hard-pressed to tell one dromornis from another, dromornises maintain tight familial structures based on pheromones and scent glands, so it's obvious when a straggler from another family is trying to encroach on a pack's den. Such disputes over breeding grounds are common; a particularly prized dromornis den might change hands several times in the course of a year. Fights between dromornis packs are chaotic and swift, marked with the sounds of terrifying screeches and sprays of blood.",,10

Dryad,"Dryads are fey guardians of the trees and creatures who dwell in wooded areas. They prefer using indirect methods to dissuade those who would harm their sacred groves and beloved forests, but they are not above using enchantments to enlist the aid of allies when evil threats cannot be dissuaded with words alone. In times of peace, dryads happily live secluded lives inside their trees, and a community at harmony with nature might not even realize a dryad lives nearby. Though they watch over all the woods around them, dryads are inextricably tied to a specific tree, usually an oak. Dryads who are bonded to another type of tree are fundamentally the same, but they may differ in temperament and appearance to match their ward. For instance, kraneiai, or cherry-tree dryads, have beautiful pink coloration and concern themselves with the fragile beauty of life.",Nymph,3
Dryad Queen,"Hamadryads rule over an entire forest, or a portion of an incredibly large forest, leading and protecting all dryads within. Hamadryads often have strange relationships with powerful and deadly fey, working together in a dualistic way despite their differences, with the hamadryad representing nature’s wonders and the other fey representing nature’s wrath.",Nymph,13
Duende,"Duendes fancy themselves as lords of the land—which is true, in a literal sense, these spirits embody the very soil upon the ground. Unlike most other fey, duendes have learned from the society that grew around them. They've come to accept the mortal understanding of what being a landlord means, so they expect rent from their perceived tenants. However, their notions of acceptable rent—and the acceptable role of a landlord for that matter—don't really line up with those of most societies. Duendes' natural abilities allow them to dwell in termite mounds, but as societies arose, they adopted the habit of sleeping in their tenants' homes. This tendency can be bothersome, as duendes don't clean up after themselves, lock doors behind them, or have the basic decency to be visible. On top of that, they act like they own the places they settle, casting spells on anyone they find annoying. These quirks are usually tolerated, though, as keeping duende happy means that crops grow well and that their magic protects the families in their care. Families aware of their presence are careful to warn invisible duendes before doing things like tossing bathwater out the window or entering a seemingly empty room. These warnings are usually polite but firm, in the vein of “Please move aside!” More prone to making trouble or being a nuisance than to violence, duendes can still prove dangerous if they feel they have no other recourse. Each one carries a toenail cutter, with full awareness that they can use it to cut other things.",,2
Duergar Bombardier,"Alchemy intrigues many duergars, and their cruel traditions often motivate them to experiment on slaves. Eager to inflict pain and justify the abuse as a method of expanding knowledge, duergar bombardiers often accompany slaver bands so they can have the first chance to select their next test subjects from captured victims. To duergar bombardiers, the lob of each bomb represents a new opportunity to observe how their targets react and record the results to enhance future modifications to their alchemical concoctions.",Duergar,1
Duergar Sharpshooter,Duergar sharpshooters serve both as ranged support for slaver parties and as snipers posted on towers overlooking quarries and other areas where enslaved workers toil away the hours. Duergar sharpshooters also specialize in nonlethal methods of ranged combat—tactics they are often called upon to use when quelling slave riots or capturing escaped slaves.,Duergar,0
Duergar Taskmaster,"Duergar priests of the taskmaster god Droskar often assume leadership roles within their communities, advancing the goals of their deity through coercion and displays of force. Often referred to as duergar taskmasters, these leaders often issue commands to duergar subordinates and slaves in the same breath, treating the two almost as if they were interchangeable. As a result, duergar taskmasters are loathed by both slave and slaver alike.",Duergar,2
Dullahan,"Riding on a horse as black as night, the headless hunter known as the dullahan tracks down and takes the heads of those it deems unfit to continue living. When closing in for the kill, the dullahan first whispers its victim’s name, then swiftly collects its prize, casting a pall of dread upon all who witness the grim execution. A dullahan manifests when a particularly violent warrior is beheaded and the warrior’s soul stubbornly clings to material existence (or is refused entry to the afterlife). Most dullahans return to their former homelands, where they can exact vengeance those they feel wronged them in life (or their living descendants). A dullahan’s concept of justice is swift and merciless, and once it has selected a target, it is unwavering in its cause. Perhaps even more than revenge on the living, a dullahan desires its own rotted head. An individual who wields the head of a dullahan is powerful indeed, for a dullahan will grudgingly serve such a master in the hopes of reclaiming its missing skull. Mighty fiends such as devils command dullahans to harvest souls or lead armies for them, while a mortal might use such an undead warrior to fulfill a personal vendetta. No matter its master’s rank or station, however, a dullahan won’t hesitate to kill its liege and reclaim its head when the opportunity presents itself. Most dullahan lairs are abandoned, overgrown ruins or other dilapidated places where severed heads and other trophies line the walls. Some dullahans, on the other hand, are content to simply commit their foul deeds and leave the remains of their decapitated victims in the streets, strewn among a copse of dead trees, or unceremoniously tossed in a bog hole.",,7

Animals favored by the dvorovoi become healthy, strong, and obedient, while less-loved livestock are exhausted and miserable. Peasants with a resident dvorovoi make sure to formally introduce new livestock to the house spirit and placate the spirit by leaving meals in the shed. Dvorovoi loathe white-furred animals and chase away any all-white cows or horses, though they have no similar grudge against chickens.",House Spirit,3
Dweomercat,"Dweomercats are magically gifted felines from the First World, where they prey upon other creatures and feed upon their primal energy. They are sometimes encountered in areas of the Material Plane where the veil to the First World is thin, or in regions where magic has been irreparably warped. Dweomercats are famous for their ability to twist the metaphorical strings of spells cast on or near them, which they can transform into their own defensive magic or tap into to instantly teleport across the battlefield.",,7
Dybbuk,"The discorporated spirits called dybbuks arise from souls denied respite in the afterlife, often because they committed some great transgression in life. A priest can appease dybbuks by helping them achieve some esoteric mission, though these tricksters are prone to deceiving anyone who offers them aid. Only by trapping, cowing, or destroying such spirits can a mortal hope to drive them back. Dybbuks hide within household objects or possessed victims. They particularly enjoy taking over the body of someone their target loves and then slowly destroying the lives of both.",,15

Commonly called flint beasts, eberarks drag their overlarge claws (four on each paw) along the ground as they move, creating showers of sparks with every grating step. Incredibly vain, eberarks relish displaying their dominance over other intelligent beings. Some eberarks conquer small settlements, demanding tribute from residents and travelers, or lead bands of violent brigands.",,10
Ecorche,"When a necromancer has need of a versatile agent to serve as a bodyguard and do their bidding in disguise, they build an ecorche—a skinless monstrosity filled with putrid alchemical agents, covered in pulsing muscle and sinew grafts, and imbued with razor-sharp claws. The ecorche uses its claws to flay its victims, stripping off skin in seconds. It can then horrifyingly squeeze itself into the stolen skin and impersonate the deceased, which it does to covertly carry out orders or find more victims to expand its collection. If its deception is uncovered, it shreds its disguise, bursting forth in terrible skinless form.",,16
Efreeti,"The efreet are hateful and merciless genies from the Plane of Fire, where they build metropolises and massive trade centers that draw extraplanar travelers from across the multiverse. They are cruel slavers, vengeful warmongers, and sinister wish-masters; there are many tales of mortals who made pacts with efreet only to have their words twisted to suit a genie’s capricious and malevolent whims.Efreet do not readily treat with other genies; they share an eternal feud with the djinn, disdain marids, regard jann as weaklings unworthy of the genie title, and only occasionally tolerate alliances with shaitans. At 12 feet tall and weighing 2,000 pounds, efreet are formidable opponents and cow their chosen victims with a glance.",Genie,9
Einherji,"Einherjar are mighty warriors chosen by valkyries from the ranks of those slain in terrible and legendary battles. Forged from the souls of the greatest warriors, the implacable einherjar serve as the foot soldiers of pantheons, skilled in hand-to-hand combat and slaying giants. Einherjar often come from warrior cultures, including Ulfen vikings (like the einherji represented in this entry), particularly fierce pirates from the Shackles, and even Osirian conquerors. They can be chosen from wherever war and might hold sway; many deities who hold the call of battle and the pursuit of physical power more sacred than concepts of good and evil might count einherjar warriors and valkyrie choosers of the slain among their chosen servitors. For example, Gorum, Besmara, and Sekhmet have all elevated fallen worshippers as einherjar. Einherjar dedicated to different deities often wield weapons or possess varying cosmetic appearances based on their deity's preferred weapon and their place of death; however, they're universally stalwart, implacable, and efficiently deadly. Einherjar with two-handed weapons or who arise from other backgrounds often have different abilities in place of Jotun Slayer and Instant Repair.",,10
Elananx,"These strange, fey felines resemble large, broad bobcats from a distance, but a closer view reveals something amiss. Their forms ripple and billow with heat, and their eyes glow from within as if they contain tiny, flickering flames. The pungent scent of rotting leaves smoldering in a bonfire clings to their fur. Yet those who have the chance to watch elananxes hunt or attack prey witness the greatest indication that these creatures are something more than mere predators, for they act with cruel and savvy instincts, reveling in the pain they infiict. Elananxes typically hunt alone, but sometimes these cunning and malicious hunters of the First World roam in packs called “billows” to take down large prey. Like many house cats, elananxes are not content to merely track and devour prey, but prefer to toy with their victims, drawing joy and excitement from the fear and pain of those they capture. To this end, elananxes rarely use their cinder dispersal ability to evade their targets, instead opting to foil their quarry just before the end of the hunt—though, as selfish creatures who wish to live to hunt again, elananxes often reserve one use of this ability, just in case. Because of their clever and malicious ways, elananxes are favored as hunting companions by redcaps, who go out of their way to befriend or make deals with these creatures. Redcaps also flnd great sport in hunts where competing elananxes chase a single creature. Although they’re large enough to serve as mounts for redcaps, elananxes despise being ridden and resist such attempts—little is as sure to cause a supposedly friendly elananx to turn on its redcap ally than a foolhardy attempt to treat the fey cat as a horse! Elananxes have a strange affinity to forest fires. Because they are immune to the damage caused by flickering flames, they enjoy capering and caterwauling through the smoky, burning ruins of forest infernos. Some have even been known to use their burning bites to deliberately light undergrowth on fire, simply so they might experience the beauty of the flames combined with the inevitable pain such disasters inflict on other creatures.",,6
Elasmosaurus,"Elasmosauruses are long-necked, primeval reptiles that dwell in deep oceans and seas. Although not truly a dinosaur, elasmosauruses are often found in similar locations and are similarly titanic creatures. Keeping their massive bodies underwater, elasmosauruses use their long necks to catch prey and snorkel air to their massive lungs while remaining mostly hidden from the surface above. An elasmosaurus is 30 feet long and weighs 6,000 pounds.As rare and reclusive as they are, elasmosauruses are sometimes mistaken for even rarer creatures called water orms, legendary aquatic denizens of remote lakes known for their elusiveness and craftiness. Whereas elasmosauruses are mundane creatures of animalistic intelligence, water orms are magical beings with near-humanoid intelligence and a curious fascination with mortals, and they seem to delight in confounding onlookers. As a result, it's theorized that a typical water orm is more than happy to lead a group of spectators to a lost elasmosaurus, both to throw its pursuers off its tail and for the hilarity that will inevitably ensue.While elasmosauruses are often found in lost worlds and unsettled regions, those who dwell in the oceans of the world do not contain their hunting grounds to specific regions. As a result, it's not unheard of for a wandering specimen to find its way to coastal waters. Those that do often find the ports of small towns or even large cities to be wondrous banquets and are usually hunted down by coastal guards or adventurers. When a wayward elasmosaurus like this finds its way into a city's sewer system or reservoirs, though, it can become the stuff of urban legends.",,7

When one does deign to speak to a non-elder thing, it's either out of fear (for a creature they know vastly outstrips their own power) or with an insufferable sense of narcissistic superiority and impatience, like how an arrogant professor might speak to a student struggling with what they perceive to be a simple concept.",Elder Thing,5
Elder Thing Researcher,"As one would expect from a species capable of living for thousands of years, many elder things grow more powerful than the standard specimen. Elder thing researchers are among the more frequently encountered of these incredibly rare beings, for their nature and interests often see them traveling to distant worlds to explore and lay the foundations for later conquest and colonization.

Emperor Bird,"The emperor bird is native to the jungles of the Mwangi Expanse and known for its brilliant plumage and innate magic. While it usually feeds on lizards, big insects, and other small creatures, the emperor bird is highly territorial and not afraid to attack larger prey. Its beak, resembling that of the much smaller peafowl, is exceptionally sharp, but its deadliest weapon is its tail—the long, whiplike blades of bone hidden among its tail feathers are a nasty surprise for any predator trying to sneak up on the bird. The emperor bird was given its current name 2,000 years ago when Taldor’s Sixth Army of Exploration ventured into the Mwangi Expanse. When the legion spotted this 6-foot-long bird with its spectacular multicolored feathers trailing from its tail, wings, and crest, the soldiers thought the bird regal enough to suit their emperor, disregarding the name the Mwangi had given to the bird generations before, bebaki. Keeping an emperor bird was, for many years, a sign of prestige among the nobility of Taldor. That was long ago, however, and emperor birds eventually fell out of fashion. Inevitably their former owners forgot about their colorful pets, and hundreds of neglected emperor birds were released back into the wild by weary servants. While many such freed birds perished quickly in the unfamiliar woodlands of Avistan, some managed to hold out, and emperor birds can still be encountered in the Verduran Forest. The emperor bird uses its brilliant, iridescent plumage for mating displays as well as for intimidating rival suitors and potential predators. Not only are the feathers beautiful, but they are actually magical—a fact that has piqued the interest of alchemists and wizards alike, many of whom have spent decades capturing and breeding emperor birds in the hope of unlocking their arcane secrets. Mages stationed in the Mwangi Expanse will pay a pretty penny for intact feathers from these majestic creatures—or better yet, live specimens.",,2

Empress Bore Worm,"When an area lacks sufficient food, the bore worms in a swarm become increasingly agitated and desperate. Eventually, at some chemical signal, the worms begin to cannibalize each other, devouring one other in a frenzy too gruesome to behold. A single worm emerges from this melee victorious; it rapidly grows larger and more voracious until it reaches an absolutely elephantine size. This empress bore worm lives only briefly, as it sets out in search of a new feeding ground and eats everything in its path in an attempt to sustain itself. However, the empress bore worm's ravenous metabolism demands more from its body than what it can physically sustain, as it exists only as a vessel for the next generation. Most live only a few days, or weeks at best, traveling and eating nonstop before dying—and in so doing, giving birth to new swarms of bore worms.",Bore Worm,7
Ephialtes,Ephialtes velstracs are consummate and fearless hunters of the doomed and the damned.,Velstrac,16
Eremite,"Eremites roam the planes to seek out ideal portions of other creatures, such as a hero's sword-arm or an angel's pinions. Eremites capture these specimens to clinically test their true limits, then harvest specimens and add them to their own bodies. An eremite might attach tongues to their hand as extra fingers or a fist to the back of their neck in a horrid “improvement.” Eremites average 7 feet tall and weigh approximately 200 pounds.",Velstrac,20
Erinys,"Erinyes exact vengeance and bloody justice for a creature’s crimes, torturing and punishing their victims in ironic fashion before allowing them the escape of death. While an erinys appears as a fallen angel and the first erinyes shared that origin, erinyes now originate in myriad ways, some promoted from lesser devils and others shaped from lemures themselves forged from the souls of torturers and persecutors. The erinyes’ origin is entwined with Eiseth, herself a fallen angel and one of Hell’s most powerful demigods. The first erinyes were all considered to be Eiseth’s metaphorical daughters, but erinyes formed since that time are no longer limited to a single gender.",Devil,8

Esipil,"Among the least of the sahkils, esipils delight in spreading fears and uncertainty among people who live with animals that could turn on them. They generally appear to their prey as some benign creature such as a domesticated dog or cat, but once they gain trust and get their victims close, they transform into a terrifying creature that looks part dog and part worm with tendrils of viscera that the creature uses as both a tongue and a weapon. Of all the sahkils, esipils are most likely to ingratiate themselves with mortals, sometimes serving powerful spellcasters and other times simply living among unsuspecting victims, biding their time until they strike.",Sahkil,1
Esobok,"Esoboks are brute hunters and pugnacious sentinels that serve as the guard dogs of the Boneyard. These squat, powerful quadrupeds have a frill of dark feathers around their distinctive heads which resemble a crocodile skull. Esoboks rarely bother with those who are truly dead, allowing the dead of the Boneyard to go about their business while remaining watchful for danger. Though cunning when sniffing out threats to the Boneyard or to their psychopomp handlers, they're among the least intelligent of the psychopomps and rarely speak except to utter growling threats. The wise listen when an esobok makes a threat, as it won't do so twice.",Psychopomp,3
Ether Spider,"Ether spiders are deadly predators from the Ethereal Plane resembling giant arachnids. Rather than building webs of silk, ether spiders shape the raw essence of the Ethereal Plane, weaving it in complex patterns that drift through the misty void. From these ethereal nests, whole families of ether spiders can scout the adjacent Material Plane, watching for easy prey in dark or remote corners of the land of mortals. Once an ether spider has spotted a meal, it anchors its nest and waits on the Ethereal Plane for its prey to draw near. As soon as its victim is within reach, the ether spider shifts to the Material Plane, clamps its fangs onto its prey, then shifts back to the Ethereal Plane to wait as its venom works through the creature’s system. Ether spiders move between the planes with ease, making them extremely dangerous to those who cannot see or attack ethereal enemies. Ether spiders are not mindless or evil—they are simply hungry. If a prospective meal can sate an ether spider’s incredible appetite through other means, they might be able to bargain for their life. Ether spiders are especially interested in items, information, or allies who can help them against their enemies. As many as half a dozen ether spiders might dwell in the same ether web. Although ether spiders enjoy one another’s company, they don’t form the same bonds as most humanoids, and they are more likely to feast on the corpse of a fallen sibling than save one from certain doom. Ether spiders dwell in vast nests adrift in the Ghost World, where they are more likely to let down their guard. Travelers who find a floating ether spider commune should have an easier time of making peaceful contact to trade with or even befriend these strange arachnids. The nests drift on metaphysical currents and are rarely seen in the same vicinity twice. Sometimes a point of interest on the neighboring Material Plane compels them to tether their nest to an area, creating a semipermanent home, and those who learn its location can return to it repeatedly.",,5
Etioling Blightmage,"When the primal spark of the First World nestled in a gnome's heart is engulfed in Radiant Fire, it fights back, pushing against death with riotous life and creating an etioling. Within their small frames, churning positive and negative energy fiercely battle for dominance, occasionally causing convulsions and babbling speech. This intense inner conflict warps an etioling's primal magic, transmogrifying it into an occult hybrid singular to these unfortunate mortics. Nearly devoid of color, etiolings have vibrant eyes and pulsing green veins. Their bodies force the corrupting negative energy out through their pores, where it distills on their skin, covering them in a thin layer of ectoplasm and concentrated death. Around them, the world withers. Incapable of focusing for long, etiolings are impulsive and moody, rapidly alternating between kindness, malice, and trickery. They forget themselves, their friends, and the things they once loved.",Mortic,10
Ettin,"Two heads aren’t always better than one. The slovenly, violent giants known as ettins are proof enough of that. The origin of these two-headed brutes is unknown, but few who encounter ettins ponder their beginnings for long. Rather, the first priority for most creatures during such a confrontation is escape, which is not easy to accomplish given the ettins’ notorious vigilance. In this way, two heads are better than one—ettins regularly find employ in the ranks of giant or orc armies as sentries and guards. The benefits of an ettin security detail are obvious: because it has a shared stomach, an ettin requires only the same amount of food as one typical ogre, yet its two sets of eyes make it twice as observant. An ettin never complains for lack of company, either. The ettin’s two heads are uniquely content to squabble and converse between themselves, and though they bicker incessantly, most couldn’t dream of life without the other. Much like some twins, an ettin has two individual minds who nonetheless consider the other as much a part of their life as their own self. Ettins do not resemble a single giant heritage so much as an amalgamation of several. Their tusks are thought to stem from orc ancestry, though their size and dimness suggest hill giant blood. Though they tower over goblins and hobgoblins, ettins are more than at home among tribes of these creatures and enjoy their comfortable stations as camp lookouts or troop rearguards. Their exposure to a wide variety of goblinoids and giants is evident in their language; ettins speak a pidgin tongue of Goblin, Jotun, and Orcish, and their diction is mostly good enough to get across the general meaning of their short sentences and bumbled sayings—although most interlocutors simply nod their heads while conversing with an ettin anyway. The monsters are notoriously short tempered and, despite their heightened visual perception, short sighted in matters of keeping their allies alive.",,6
Eunemvro,"Eunemvros wander the Material Plane with the sole purpose of destroying undead. These mysterious beings claim to hail from the Positive Energy Plane, although they have no direct evidence of their supposedly otherworldly origins other than their unusual appearance: tall, lean humanoids with an okapi's head. If they truly hail from the Positive Energy Plane, they don't seem to have any method to return there and have made their home on the Material Plane—a home, unfortunately, infested by the unnatural living dead. Beings composed or animated by negative energy—including lowly skeletons and zombies as well as wights and ghouls—rightly fear confrontation with a eunemvro, for few other creatures possess innate abilities so perfectly suited for the eradication of such monsters with but a touch. In addition to magical abilities, eunemvros are adept martial artists whose mighty fists and feet channel the force of positive energy with every blow. Most of these solitary hunters believe mortals incapable of comprehending their cosmic mandate, though they themselves only understand this drive as a directive instilled in them by the strange powers that sent them to the Material Plane. If pressed, some eunemvro might grudgingly accept aid from those who have proven capable of slaying the undead.",,5
Evangelist,"Evangelists, the velstracs' unofficial ambassadors, roam the farthest reaches of the planes to spread the word of their kind's abhorrent belief in perfection through pain. They are therefore the most frequently encountered velstracs on the Material Plane, leading covens of hedonistic mortal flesh-sculptors or serving as wardens of horrific dungeons. In regions ruled by infernal powers, evangelists may serve as lieutenants or advisors, whispering secret paths to power in exchange for mortal's souls or choice mortal flesh. Evangelists are the same size as humans, although with the heavy chains that always drape their forms, they often weigh 350 pounds or more.",Velstrac,6
Excorion,"These hideous undead creatures result from an exquisitely painful necromantic process where flayed humanoids are animated through their exposed blood vessels. Cults of undeath typically punish apostates and renegades with this cruel method of reanimation, though sacrificial victims or unfortunate prisoners might suffer a similar fate. Excorions have supernaturally strong, pulsing veins that extend outward from their bodies like thousands of tiny, bloody cilia. Excorions move their bulks not with their dead muscles but with heaving contractions of their blood vessels, which pull them along in a swift but jerky manner. Excorions can shift their magical blood easily throughout their bodies, allowing them to squirt blood from their gaping, skinless mouths or to messily mark their foes. Most excorions are so broken by the process of their creation that they retain few memories of their past lives or identities. This is, typically, a minor blessing in their cursed tale, protecting the excorion's former friends and family from truly realizing their horrific fate.",,7

Faceless Butcher,"The deformed flesh on this humanoid horror’s head bears grim holes where their eyes, nose, mouth, and ears should be, and little else. Stories of faceless butchers always center on the monstrous murderer’s preferred weapon: a wicked and bloodstained meat cleaver, which the butcher uses to carve flesh from skull to add to their collection of stolen faces. Once they’ve taken a victim’s face, the faceless butcher can wear it, transform into an exact replica of the deceased, and begin stalking their next victim.",,11
Faceless Stalker,"Among the subtler of the alghollthu creations were the ugothols—also known as faceless stalkers. These twisted beings used shapeshifting to infiltrate settlements and assassinate key targets. They sowed discord and replaced leaders, causing unwanted organizations to implode and bothersome people to lose face and eventually disappear. Entirely terrestrial in nature, ugothols can easily extend alghollthu plots above the waves for extended periods of time, giving their aquatic masters enhanced reach into these unpleasantly dry realms. Today, most faceless stalkers—like the less dangerous ulat-kinis—pursue programmed goals without the guidance of alghollthu rule. Faceless stalkers prefer to live as close to the sea coast as possible, although they are not aquatic creatures themselves. Most dwell in tiny tribes in marshlands. Others live in the sewers of coastal towns. By instinct, faceless stalkers seek to sow discord. They replace leaders in humanoid societies, then guide infiltrated settlements down paths of destruction. Among humanoids who have wicked tendencies, a faceless stalker can become a prominent trailblazer, leading a group to new heights of depravity and violence. Inevitably, however, faceless stalker infiltrators lead their followers to ruin. The ugothol eventually moves on—either because its true nature is about to be discovered, or because it has despoiled or devastated all local resources. An ugothol gains nourishment only through its long, bloodsucking tongue. Their prey bear distinctive triple puncture wounds near major arteries. Corpses bearing such marks are typically the first clues found to uncover a faceless stalker’s presence, though sometimes they are overlooked as marks belonging to a vampire or chupacabra.",Alghollthu,4
Facetbound Cascader,"Facetbound cascaders must have been arcane spellcasters in life; in undeath, they draw upon the power of embedded orange prism aeon stone to defend themselves from magical damage and redirect that energy toward their opponents.

Fading Fox,"With fur that shifts between hues of red, dull brown, and silver as it moves, the fading fox vexes any pursuer.

Fading foxes have lustrous fur and a robust build that set them apart from their red fox progenitors.",Fox,2
Faerie Dragon,"Although they are much smaller than their larger dragon cousins, faerie dragons have the many of the same physiological attributes, including long necks, toothy maws, sinuous tails, and sharp claws. They flit about on iridescent butterfly wings, the coloring of which changes based on where they live, giving them a natural camouflage. Unlike their larger kin, an adult faerie dragon remains the same size throughout its lifespan. The only visual clue to the age of a faerie dragon is the sheen on its scales, a glimmer that becomes more lustrous the older it gets. Faerie dragons usually exhibit pleasant and good-natured temperaments, though they have a mischievous streak that leads them to play tricks on those around them. In search of an amusement, they prefer harmless annoyances to wounding malice. While often spontaneous, they may also spend months if not years planning the perfect prank. Especially responsive targets endear themselves to faerie dragons and may create a lifelong bond. A faerie dragon’s reputation as a trickster leads many to associate them with fey, with whom the tiny dragons have cordial relationships. Peaceful by nature, faerie dragons do not enjoy confrontation. If faced with hostility, they prefer to remain at a distance and breathe euphoric gas at their foes, diffusing the skirmish by creating an atmosphere of bliss. If conflict escalates, they target their opponents with spells, using their renowned trickery to escape. If their companions are in danger, however, their desire to remain out of combat changes. Faerie dragons protect their friends by any means available, including physical combat. Sometimes as faerie dragons grow older, their connection to the First World grows stronger. In addition to growing more lustrous and vibrant in appearance, these faerie dragons gain an increasing amount of magical primal power. Such faerie dragons increase in strength as appropriate—a faerie dragon of 20th level or even higher is possible, but it is exceptionally unusual to encounter a faerie dragon of 9th level or higher beyond the most remote regions of the First World. When creating a more powerful faerie dragon, change its tradition to primal and grant it a number of primal spells known appropriate for a druid of its level. Faerie dragons don’t grow much larger, regardless of how powerful they become. Those who would seek to torment or vex a faerie dragon would do well to consider this, as it’s often difficult to tell how powerful one of these tiny dragons truly is at a simple glance!",,2
Faithless Ecclesiarch,"Faithless ecclesiarchs were powerful religious leaders in life—archpriests, hierarchs, oracles, and divine servitors personally blessed by their deities. They are adept at corrupting the pious and inspiring their fellow herexens, often becoming leaders among their kind. This faithless ecclesiarch once worshipped Nethys, god of magic.",Herexen,6
Fallen Champion,"While most herexens were clerics or clergy in life, fallen champions were holy crusaders that upheld the ideals of their deity while fighting enemies of the church and defending its congregants. Fallen champions are direct in their actions and wage their divine war on a grand scale. This fallen champion once worshiped the Arcadian goddess Kazutal, also called Mother Jaguar.",Herexen,8
False Priest,"Belief is perhaps the strongest force in the universe, driving many to great heights. Instilling a sense of belief and then using that belief against someone, however, is the discipline of a false priest.

Festering Gnasher,A festering gnasher is a floating head covered in infectious pustules and hollowed out by decay.,Beheaded,1
Festrog,"Spawned from corpses of those who died of illness or starvation and twisted by negative energy, festrogs display a visciousness that rivals other undead. They resemble decaying humanoids, but with elongated arms, teeth, and bone-like spikes protruding from their upper backs. Festrogs' tendency to run on all fours has led to them gaining the moniker dog-ghouls, causing the unwary to mistake them for mindless predators. Festrogs are in fact intelligent, stalking victims in packs and choosing hunting grounds that suit their abilities. They can often be found roaming farmlands, open forests, or wide plains, anywhere they can use their quadrupedal speed to overtake quarry. Belying their mindless appearance, festrogs use tactics similar to those of hunters with hounds: the leader of the pack often flushes prey from cover so that the victim can be brought down by the pack. Researchers of the necromantic processes that creates risen corpses have found that festrogs spawn more often from slow demises than sudden deaths. Festrogs typically animate from corpses afflicted with disease, while victims of violence are more likely to become more common undead, such as zombies. One documented way to create a festrog is to have scavengers feed on the dead flesh before animating it. This potentially explains why festrogs most often arise in remote areas stricken with famine and desperate predators. Though most festrogs arise from humans and other prevalent humanoids, other creatures that die in the same circumstances can rise as festrogs. Festrogs that were once larger humanoids such as ogres, hill giants, or trolls behave similarly to other humanoid festrogs and are simply larger and more powerful. More peculiar are the beastkin festrogs formed of quadrupedal animals, which typically have feet or hooves instead of hands, travel on all fours at all times, and have only animal intelligence. In fact, some humanoid festrogs capture and starve beastkin in hopes of the creatures rising as grotesque festrog pets.",,1

Fetchling Scout,"The people known today as fetchlings are a distinct ancestry descended from generations of humans who became trapped ages ago on the Shadow Plane. No longer human at all, these people, who call themselves kayals, have become monochromatic in coloration, with flesh tones and hair colors varying between white, black, and all shades of gray. Their limbs are lithe and willowy, and their eyes are generally solid yellow, yellow-green, or white, though a rare few have a purple or blue glow. Fetchlings have developed their own complex societies in the Shadow Plane, often under the tolerance of or in servitude to the strange, malignant creatures there, such as the sinister velstracs or the enigmatic d'ziriaks. While individual fetchlings can be any alignment, they are all survivors in a harsh environment, which leads to a tendency toward pragmatism. Fetchling clothing mimics the regions they dwell in, with drab colors tending toward darker shades. When they trade with humans or other societies on the Material Plane, they often wear masks or concealing clothing to hide their appearance. Typical fetchling communities are insular and swiftly close ranks in the event of an intruder. Though individual fetchlings don't mind traveling to and blending in with other societies to facilitate trade, they often hide or even react defensively if they have their own visitors. When one considers the nature of the other denizens of the Shadow Plane, however, this tendency to assume the worst of interlopers might make sense to some. Fetchlings are not as common on the Material Plane; most of those who dwell there are loners by choice who have left their home to seek out adventure elsewhere, exiles who were banished from their homelands, or planar castaways with no ability to return to the Shadow Plane. This last category, the lost and stranded, are the most likely to be found in larger groups. In cities of significant size, one can sometimes even find a small community of a few dozen or more fetchlings living among humans, although they often do so subtly by dyeing their hair, wearing brightly colored clothing, and utilizing layers of makeup to hide their pallid complexions.",Fetchling,1
Fiddling Bones,"To some, music is more than a hobby—it's an obsession.

Driven to prove themselves even in undeath, fiddling bones often challenge famous performers to music duels.",,3

Fire Giant,"The most militaristic of all giants, fire giants focus obsessively on learning combat techniques, mastering the arts of forging weapons and armor, and finding new ways to dominate their enemies. As a result, their social and political structures are grounded firmly in martial hierarchies, with a strict emphasis on following the orders of one’s superior, no matter if you are accountable to a lowly soldier or report to a powerful officer. As soon as a fire giant can walk, they are fitted with their first suit of forged armor. This armor is constantly remolded and replaced as the fire giant matures, both to ensure they are comfortable with steel against their skin and also to teach the giant as early as possible that they bear the burden of fighting to protect their traditions and way of life. To a fire giant, death is the flame in which the future is forged. Fire giants are usually identified by their powerful stature, bright-orange hair that flickers and dances as if it were aflame, and heavy steel armor worn over garments of crimson, amber, or black. Most fire giants are covered in scars and refuse to conceal or obstruct them, as each jagged mark serves as a reminder of a valuable lesson they learned in battle. A typical fire giant stands 12 to 16 feet tall, weighs about 7,000 pounds, and lives to be 350 years old.",Giant,10
Fire Jellyfish Swarm,"While individually one of these fist-sized jellyfish is merely a nuisance, in great numbers, fire jellyfish can form into dangerous swarms. Bobbing in the water, they create a cloud of stinging tentacles. They were named in part for their bright coloration, but those who are stung by fire jellyfish learn the larger reason for their name—the pain of their stings is comparable to being burned alive.",Jellyfish,6
Fire Mephit,"Fire mephits are conniving and quick to anger. They aren’t evil, but they delight in inflicting pain, and their love of burning things pushes them the closest to this alignment of all mephits. They have bright-orange skin, and wisps of flame flicker along their wings as they flap through the air. The rivalry between fire and water mephits is notorious, and these creatures loathe working together for any amount of time.","Elemental, Mephit",1
Fire Wisp,"Fire wisps are sizzling spheres of flame and ash, perpetually crackling and shimmering with heat. They're carefree, boisterous, and quick to action— sometimes recklessly so.","Elemental, Wisp",0
Fire Yai,"Fire yai take the form of fire giants. Like fire giants, fire yai are shrewd and militaristic and have an incredible appetite for the thrill of war. While they engage in battle to conquer and control others, fire yai also love the thrill of war, fighting for the sheer joy of it. Presenting a fire yai with a true challenge in combat can potentially earn their mercy and an offer to join and serve at their side. Fire yai's third eyes shoot forth burning missiles of fire.",Oni,14

Fjord Linnorm,"Fjord linnorms make their homes in damp caves behind ice-cold waterfalls in the river-veined coastal reaches of the north. While they may appear graceful as they swim up the fjords for which they're named, they are as vile as any other of their species and take pleasures in capsizing river boats before gobbling up their terrified crews.",Linnorm,16
Flame Drake,"The distant kin of red dragons, flame drakes thankfully lack the intelligence and ambition of their larger cousins, but are no less territorial or violent. Flame drakes dwell near volcanoes and magma, but it’s not unheard of for one to drift into nearby areas like forests or wooded hills. Their scales are usually some shade of red, occasionally fading to smoky blacks and grays along the edges of their wings and the tips of their tails.",Drake,5
Flaming Skull,"More dangerous than simple severed heads, these skulls are wreathed in unearthly flames.",Beheaded,2
Flash Beetle,"These 3-foot-long insects boast a pair of glowing organs on the back of the abdomen that give off bright light and that continue to glow for days, even after the creature’s death. Flash beetles are commonly herded and harvested by miners and spelunkers, as their glow is considered safer than torches and less expensive than lamps. Denizens of the Darklands often domesticate and train these insects, using them as pets, livestock, or caging them to use as organic sources of light in areas frequented by visitors unaccustomed to the darkness.",Beetle,-1
Flea Swarm,"Flea swarms roil across city streets and rural hinterlands in a hissing, scraping scrabble, draining blood from any creatures unfortunate enough to cross their path.",Flea,5
Flesh Golem,"Made of odd scraps of skin and muscle, a flesh golem is a grotesque parody of life. Though it has no mind, it can still go into a berserk rage when harmed, giving it a faint semblance of emotion. Flesh golems guard the laboratories and charnel houses of fleshwarpers and necromancers who feel no compunctions about desecrating corpses for their own ends. Though the first flesh golem is believed to have been a misguided attempt to create from simple base elements, these monstrosities are far from human. In isolated cases, echoes of a personality might rise in a flesh golem if the brain used as part of its construction belonged to a particularly powerful personality, but such tragic instances are (thankfully) rare in the extreme.",Golem,8
Flickerwisp,"The dancing, twisting flickerwisp is a less powerful but no less malevolent type of will-o'-wisp. Like their more dangerous kin, flickerwisps prefer to haunt lonely swamps or stretches of lonely rivers or creeks, particularly near the shorelines where they can pass themselves off as nothing more than a small gathering of fireflies. A flickerwisp's body is a 3-foot-long length of hair-like fibers that flashes and pulses with ribbons and points of eerie yellow light as the creature flits through the air. While a flickerwisp can taste fear, and finds the flavor delectable, it does not feed on this emotion. Instead, flickerwisps subsist on confusion and doubt. The sense of unease a traveler exudes when they become lost in the woods is flickerwisps' favorite repast. They can sip from this sense of disorientation without betraying their presence or harming their prey. Eventually, the flickerwisps grow too hungry and are compelled to flit closer, confuse their prey, and glut on the raw emotions. Flickerwisps do their best to swoop away before death occurs, and the most skilled of these tormentors can keep a chosen meal alive for days, sipping from confusion in small doses.",Wisp,2
Floating Femur,Floating femurs can deliver a powerful blow. They make handy weapons for those who manage to grab hold of them. ,Animated Bones,-1
Flumph,"Even among the numerous types of tentacled aberrations populating the lands of Golarion, flumphs are an anomaly. Unlike most other aberrations, flumphs' monstrous appearance belies their true nature as gentle, good-natured creatures whose self-imposed duty is to bolster the defenses of worlds across the multiverse against onslaught from the cosmic horrors of the Dark Tapestry between the stars. Flumphs are small, jellyfish-like creatures who normally float about 5 feet off the ground on a self-generated cushion of wind, directing their movements with jets of air from countless tiny pores on the surface of their bodies. With some effort, the flumph can force air through these openings in a way that roughly approximates humanoid speech, albeit in a squeaky and halting tone. Though a flumph's underside is ringed with an array of acidic spikes that they use to hunt small prey, they are nearly defenseless against most attackers and usually attempt to flee when threatened. If cornered, a flumph can emit a foul-smelling spray capable of temporarily incapacitating enemies while warning nearby allies of their presence. This olfactory defense mechanism causes flumphs to feel more kinship with terrestrial creatures than with the jellyfish to which they bear a closer physical resemblance. Flumphs hatch from pods flung into outer space from the distant flumph homeworld in a ritual known as the Seeding. Even a newly hatched flumph has an instinctive knowledge of their purpose and seeks to make a lair close to a nearby settlement, which they then adopt as their personal charge to protect. However, remaining acutely aware of both their physical limitations and the tendency of their appearance to frighten the unsuspecting, most flumphs recruit and guide from afar, revealing their true nature only to their most trusted allies. In addition to their missions, flumphs endeavor to lead upstanding lives on a daily basis. They notably draw guidance from their dreams through exhaustive interpretations and carefully maintained dream journals. Life lessons, areas in which they can improve their behavior, and portents of alien danger all come to flumphs in dreams—or at least, that's what they believe. Despite placing so much importance on dreams, flumphs have never set out to prove their dreams are authentic messages.",,1
Fluxwraith,"To cheat mortality, the rare spellcaster turns to potent temporal stasis magic, or even cryogenic technology. However, such methods are highly unreliable and often fracture the sleeper's soul across the time stream as their physical body perishes. Such an individual can rise as a fluxwraith, an incorporeal undead with a kaleidoscopic consciousness.",,17
Flytrap Leshy,"While often seen as unfriendly by non-leshys, flytrap leshys get along well with other leshys. Nonetheless, they're among the most aggressive leshys, often guarding the most vulnerable places in the natural world with their flytrap mouths and hands. When a large threat emerges, pairs of flytrap leshys band together to create amalgams capable of driving back powerful foes. This unusual form of communal defense suffuses flytrap leshy society, and they often form relationships between multiple individuals that would confuse or even scandalize more uptight humanoids—to a flytrap leshy, though, there's nothing strange about sharing your innermost secrets with people you literally merged together with to defend your home from an enemy.",Leshy,4
Formian Mageslayer,"Grim, twisted formians forced into existence through the machinations of the King of Biting Ants, formian mageslayers are created for the express purpose of neutralizing and destroying enemy spellcasters. Wired to never sleep, mageslayers are tortured hunters and guardians whose only relief is found in tearing apart the magic and flesh of spellcasters who oppose the King of Biting Ants. Formian mageslayers have wings resembling those of dragonflies and longer, sleeker bodies than most formians.",Formian,16
Formian Queen,"The formian queen is the center of the formian hive. The queen identifies and attends to the hive's needs, laying egg clusters that vary from a single formian born to a particular task to hundreds of workers at a time. All formians are born with an instinctive deference for the queen that borders on slavish devotion, though this urge can be corrupted, as with the King of Biting Ants' mutant mageslayers.",Formian,17
Formian Worker,"By far the most common formian on Akiton, workers are focused and industrious, naturally skilled at manual labor and coordinating with peers.",Formian,1
Fortune Eater,"The fickle finger of fate has quashed hundreds of fledgling adventurers, sometimes in a particularly memorable or ignominious manner. When a number of would-be heroes perish together in such a way, their restless spirits might arise—spurred by jealousy—to become a fortune eater. A fortune eater is a collective entity that might lurk near fortune tellers, taverns, or Pathfinder Society lodges where adventurers are likely to pass through. The spirit then follows the heroes on their quests until the right moment, when the spirit manifests their unfortunate abilities to get the party killed and potentially add them to the collective. Sometimes they linger near the lairs of a powerful monster, waiting for parties of unwary adventurers. A fortune eater lingers because of unfinished business: to move on, they must help a hero defeat a great threat or acquire a legendary item. Ironically, their jealousy, rage, and powers of bad luck make this extremely unlikely.",,7
Fossil Golem,"Fossil golems are typically made from the fossilized bones of dinosaurs and other ancient megafauna, though some crafters stretch the definition and instead use magically petrified bones of dragons or even giants. Not bound to any specific model, fossil golems are crafted to be as terrifying as possible instead of models of anatomic accuracy. As such, most fossil golems are nightmarish saurian amalgams whose massive arms end with the complete skulls of apex predators like tyrannosauruses, their bite enhanced to petrify flesh. The enchantments that animate fossil golems grant them a form of modular flexibility, letting them trade mobility for extended reach through the rapid rearrangement of their limbs. This also lets them appear like a jumbled mass of bones at rest, making them likely to be mistaken for decor rather than guardians.",Golem,12
Froghemoth,"A terrifying abomination of teeth, tentacles, and unbridled rage, the froghemoth is thankfully rarely encountered even in the deepest swamplands or most remote Darklands caverns. Capable of devouring dinosaurs and even dragons, it is a frighteningly effective ambush hunter, immersing itself in the mire with only its eyestalk protruding and watching in every direction at once with uncanny precision.",,13
Frost Drake,"Frost drakes pose an immense danger in the frozen reaches they call home, where they roam far and wide to hunt for prey such as caribou, wolves, small bears, and tundra-dwelling people. Related as they are to white dragons, these drakes share many habits and facets of their disposition with their draconic cousins. Indeed, just as white dragons are among the most bestial and craven of dragonkind, frost drakes are among the most depraved and openly malicious of the drakes. They are also especially insolent, and are less likely to back down from a flight compared to other drakes. Many frost drakes have met their ends trying to enact cruelties beyond their means, such as singly taking on an entire castle or well-fortified township. Although a frost drake can wreak much destruction on its own, tales of village-dwelling northerners banding together to defend their homes from these rogue menaces are fairly common. A frost drake’s hunting grounds are quite large. Those frost drakes that live upon the permanently frozen peaks of high mountains have been known to swoop down to snatch up prey from the lowlands, leaving frozen swaths of earth from their breath as the only sign of their passing. Their frost-covered scales range from deep royal blue to crisp cyan and sometimes feature sporadic patches of violet. Their hides are thinner than most drakes’; when a frost drake is inhaling in preparation to launch its signature frozen breath, the monster’s ice-blue blood can be seen beneath its scales.",Drake,7
Frost Giant,"Frost giants are remorseless marauders who pillage and plunder from those who dare to live near them in desolate, frigid lands. Their clans range from extremely territorial hunters who claim an expanse of tundra and defend it at all costs to nomadic hordes that roam icy slopes in search of settlements to conquer. Frost giant clans are ruled by those who exhibit the greatest ferocity and prowess in battle—massive brutes who proclaim themselves jarl and demand absolute obedience from their followers. If at any time a frost giant wishes to be a jarl, all they must do is issue a challenge to the current jarl and face off in mortal combat, after which the reigning champion continues leading the clan or the victorious challenger assumes control. Frost giants live in frostbitten realms, and their appearance is reflective of a people weathered and hardened by relentless snowstorms and freezing temperatures. They often wear metal armor adorned with the furs, skin, teeth, and tusks of slain beasts and heft weapons as long as dining tables. Their flesh ranges from pale blue to shale gray, and their hair is typically a dingy white or dirty yellow color. A typical frost giant stands about 15 feet tall and weighs approximately 2,800 pounds.",Giant,9
Frost Troll,"Frost trolls are nightmarish frozen monsters of rime-stained claws and hoarfrost teeth. Possessing wits superior to those of common trolls, frost trolls often hunt in packs of three—one attacking their quarry openly while the remaining two pause to assess weaknesses before moving in for the kill. Frost trolls relish the taste of human flesh and adjust their hunting grounds seasonally to remain in close proximity to their favorite prey. Of slighter frame than common trolls, a typical frost troll stands 11 feet tall when not hunched and weighs 900 pounds. Their sickly, cracked flesh is of an icy, cerulean pallor. Frost trolls often adorn themselves with trophies of bone and hide flayed from their kills.",Troll,4
Frost Worm,"The frost worm's single round, red eye gleams prominently at the head of its monstrous mass, white as a winter snowfall. What appears to be a bifurcated lower jaw is actually two spiky parapodia that the worm uses to shovel food into its lamprey-like mouth. An adult frost worm measures 35 feet long and weighs 8,000 pounds. A frost worm is an apex predator that uses camouflage, burrowing, and deceit to ambush its prey. When it attacks, a frost worm produces a distinctive, high-pitched trill. Though some survivors of frost worm attacks have compared it to a wailing lament, the trill has a captivating effect on nearby creatures, causing them to stop and listen even as the monstrous creature approaches. The cold shed by a frost worm is as dangerous as its trill or its jaws, and while it is not fond of warmer climates, neither is it particularly hampered in such regions. A frost worm that somehow finds itself in temperate or even tropical environs causes the immediate area to chill and ice over with frost over time, creating seemingly impossible pockets of frozen terrain.",,12
Fuath,"Despite their small size, fuaths are shipwreckers incarnate. In the dark of night, these gremlins sever ratlines, slash sails, smash sextants, and soil provisions. Once the ship founders, the fuaths return to indulge their craving for land-raised flesh. While fuaths prefer to take their prey asleep, they save a terrible doom for sailors who attack them, surrounding the mariners' faces in magically congealed water to drown them where they stand. Constantly dripping with water, fuaths have seahorse-like faces, seaweed-green fur over yellow skin, and wicked lobster claws for hands. Lacking the Undercommon tongue, they have trouble relating to other gremlins aside from hanivers, but revere sea hags and evil aquatic fey.",Gremlin,1
Fungus Leshy,"Fungus leshys guard caves, bogs, and damp, dark places. Their fungus gardens are bizarre by most standards, but fungus leshys are extremely proud of their works.",Leshy,2

Gallowdead,"The first gallowdead were hung from enormous, hooked chains from atop the Whispering Tyrant's prison, Gallowspire, and magically bonded to their chains after death. After Gallowspire's destruction, the gallowdead who remained were left to wander the ruins.",,15
Galvo,"A galvo is a bizarre humanoid creature made up of electric eels—dozens of them, transmogrified into one cooperative, electrified body. The story of their creation is lost to antiquity, though their propensity for attacking sea devils and alghollthus suggests they might have been engineered by some enemy of these creatures. Modern galvos aren't choosy about their prey, and because they can operate as well on land as they do in the water, they enjoy feasting on aquatic creatures and land dwellers alike. A galvo's body forms something roughly shaped like a human, but with eels continually moving throughout it and shifting the shape of its mass. The galvo can even disperse into a swarm of eels, though it usually does so only to travel through narrow spaces or otherwise accomplish things it's incapable of in its normal form. These component eels share some element of a collective consciousness, giving the galvo more intelligence than a typical animal. Individual galvos generally don't have any need for or interest in socializing, though they sometimes gather to collaborate while hunting. Electricity arcs throughout a galvo, and the more the eels that make it up move about, the larger and more impressive the electric display. This electricity creates a damaging field around the galvo that causes small fish and other sea life to drop dead. Many galvos contentedly snack on these prey. Even beyond the harmful field, underwater creatures feel a faint unease from galvos, and might notice how ferrous trinkets and sediment slowly drift toward them. A galvo attack could come from a lone creature or a small group. In addition to dangers of the electricity field generated by galvos' eels, galvos might attack by biting with their eels' maws or even firing off one of their eels like a dart, striking a distant target with a living, electrified projectile.

Gancanagh,"Gancanaghs are lovers, revelers, and dashing duelists of Elysium. Embodiments of free love, they eagerly throw themselves into courting targets for brief but earnest flings until their quicksilver passions change their desires. They serve Cayden Cailean as well as other bacchanalian deities and empyreal lords of Elysium who understand their desires for love and parties. Gancanaghs hate evil beings that profane the spirit of romance and passion, as such creatures (especially the demonic tempters known as succubi) reinforce stigmas against open and free love. One can give no greater insult to a gancanagh than to mistake him for such a creature, and more than one hotheaded gancanagh has challenged a misinformed paladin or other champion of good to a duel over such a slight. While they enjoy drinking and carousing, gancanaghs can’t stand smoke. Nonetheless, many gancanaghs carry whimsical-looking smoking pipes because they think it makes them look dapper. They cherish their silver flutes, for they enjoy the beauty of flutes’ music and its ability to sway the heart.The majority of gancanaghs present themselves as male, but the concept of gender to a creature like a gancanagh, which can change its shape freely, is much more fluid and open to interpretation than for many mortals. Gancanaghs enjoy using this flexibility to confront and test mortals’ convictions when faced with fear or prejudice, but when encountering mortals who themselves are open-minded about sexuality or gender identity, they can become lifelong allies. For those who are persecuted for such reasons, gancanaghs are tireless defenders and eager supporters, quick to provide safety and to punish those who would attempt to impose narrower beliefs upon a world that deserves more diversity than it often gets. If possible, a gancanagh seeks to educate and redeem those who hold destructive beliefs or prejudices, resorting to combat only to defend themself or an endangered mortal, or when no other option seems tenable—yet even then, they fight with sadness.",Azata,4

Ganzi Martial Artist,"Children of primeval chaos, ganzis intertwine the churning pandemonium of the Maelstrom with the more mundane tumult of mortal life. Some arise in bloodlines touched by creatures of chaos in generations previous, while others are changed by planar friction as the Maelstrom seethes upon the shores of creation, but all share the essence of anarchy in their blood and bone. As children of chaos, ganzis vary wildly in appearance; protean-kin remain the most common, with patches of scales and feathers and mischievous slithering tails. Others might have stranger features, such as horns, glowing orange eyes, or limbs flickering with harmless auras of entropic energy. Ganzis might be dramatically shorter, taller, thinner, or stouter than is typical for their ancestry, and it's not uncommon for them to be mistaken for more common planar scions. Independent-minded to a fault, often creative and capricious, ganzis prefer professions that allow them to serve as their own masters. If such a profession gives a ganzi opportunity to baffle or befuddle Golarion's more staid citizens, then all the better. Many ganzis develop reputations as outgoing, deviant, or thrill-seeking, and many heartily embrace these reputations and lean into them. Of all the planar scions, ganzis are among the most likely to take up life as wanderers. Ganzis with a taste for close combat are sometimes drawn to martial arts, turning their curious forms into potent and unexpected weapons. It's common to find such ganzi in the temporary employ of others, whether out of a legitimately shared ideology or simply the need for money. Just as often, though, one may simply find a ganzi martial artist demonstrating their craft on a street corner or dealing out justice to enforcers of cruel laws.",Planar Scion,3
Gargoyle,"Gargoyles are monstrous hunters made of elemental stone. They use their resemblance to decorative statues to hide in plain sight in cities during the day and descend upon unlucky pedestrians at night. Their most common form is that of a horned humanoid with bat-like wings, but individual gargoyles show a great deal of variation, with some appearing more or less humanoid and others resembling no known creature. A gargoyle’s features are not flxed; city-dwelling gargoyles who remain in the same locale long enough slowly morph, day by day, to match the style of the local architecture. These patient monsters can stay disguised for long stretches of time as they patiently await an opportunity to strike. Gargoyles tend to be lone hunters, though sometimes they band into fearsome tribes called “wings” for protection or sport. On rare occasions, wings become relatively stable communities, and gargoyles in wings may even ally with other creatures such as demons and intelligent aberrations, though these alliances exist on a razor’s edge. The majority of gargoyles are treacherous, vindictive, and petty—traits that preclude lasting partnerships. Many tend to be obsessive and compulsive. Some are collectors, focusing on anything from books to grim trophies, while others are ritualistic or overly passionate about niche intellectual subjects or certain artistic motifs. These tendencies often contribute to the dissolution of wings as individuals’ obsessions and compulsions clash. Kapoacinth Kapoacinths dwell not amid cliffs or rooftops, but beneath the sea, using their wings to swim. These water-dwelling gargoyles often dwell in shallow coastal regions and shamble forth from the sea to attack prey. Kapoacinths are less individualistic and tend to create more stable wings for longer periods of time. Kapoacinths have the same abilities as the gargoyle presented below, but with the following adjustments: they have the aquatic trait, they have a swim Speed of 40 feet instead of a fly Speed, and their Clawed Feat reaction triggers when they are Swimming instead of Flying.",,4
Garuda,"Garudas are noble, birdlike beings descended from the gods. They were born under the cerulean skies of the Outer Plane of Elysium but have since spread to the Material Plane, and it is here that they primarily reside. On Golarion,the largest garuda populations live in the rugged hills and mountains of Vudra, though some have spread to the Impossible Kingdom of Jalmeray and even to the eastern mountains of Garund. Garudas usually roost in isolated aeries but spend much of their time gliding on the wind. Many garudas are nomadic or migratory, yearning to travel and soar above new landscapes. While they remain detached from humanoid societies, they are impetuous and gallant, frequently serving as protectors of communities near the cliffs and peaks where they roost. Some garudas instead combine their wanderlust and goodhearted nature by serving as messengers and emissaries between remote settlements, though most who take up this work abandon it after a few years when the same terrain becomes boring. Wandering garudas are no less compassionate, and many a tale tells of a garuda who came to the aid of a lost traveler or carried an endangered soul to safety. Though they hold most living creatures in high regard, garudas loathe ophidian creatures—nagas in particular. Rarely do they come into contact without fighting, and a garuda will go out of their way to hunt down a naga if they hear even the tiniest hint of a rumor suggesting the presence of one. A garuda's feathering and coloration range widely depending on the terrain they favor. Garudas in temperate woodlands might resemble jays or falcons, while tropical garudas sport bright plumage.",,9
Gashadokuro,"The dreaded gashadokuro is an undead haunter of the night, spawning as a giant skeleton that rises from the earth in the aftermath of a mass starvation event. These enormous creatures then seek to inflict their unending hunger on the living. A gashadokuro that comes about due to a poor growing season is more prone to stalk remote village farmlands at night, while a gashadokuro that arose from the victims of a government-instigated food shortage has few compunctions about stomping straight into bustling cities in broad daylight. These latter gashadokuro even seem to target aristocrats and government authorities—whether or not they were the same politicians whose negligence resulted in the famine in the first place—leading many to believe that the gashadokuro seeks to slake its thirst for revenge even more than it seeks to sate its unending hunger.",,13
Gathlain Wanderer,"Gathlains have made a name for themselves as inquisitive and mischievous, as well as flighty and distractable. These eccentric little fey want nothing more than to explore the many wonders of the world for their own pleasure. Born of magical trees in seed pods that float hundreds of miles on the wind, gathlains are a bizarre mix of flesh and flora. Sprigs of mistletoe bloom from their back and form a delicate pair of wings. They enjoy adorning themselves with oddities found on their journeys, such as beads, pieces of fine cloth, and bits of armor. The fey see these accessories as trophies, proof of their travels, and mementos of their adventures. The typical gathlain is only 2 feet tall, but their small size doesn't deter them from seeking out and exploring potentially dangerous places. They sometimes even use their size to their advantage, squeezing through tight spaces that most would never be able to fit through. Moreover, their vine-laced wings let them reach heights many adventurers would find daunting. These traits have made them celebrated explorers whose presence is welcome in a group of travelers—so long as everyone is prepared for their nigh-endless questions. A conversation with a gathlain can feel more like an interrogation, as they care little for the comfort of others if it means they will learn something new and interesting to add to their range of knowledge. Gathlains are particularly fond of gnomes, as they feel a sort of familial attachment to their exiled fey kin, and attempt to ingratiate themselves with any gnomes they run across. Gnomes don't always return this affection and many tend to distrust gathlains, due to the smaller creatures' gossipy and flighty nature.",Gathlain,1
Gbahali,"Resembling an enormous, long-legged alligator, the gbahali is larger, stronger, faster, and more cunning than all but the largest of its crocodilian kin. Gbahalis will range far from the banks of the rivers they inhabit to seek prey. With a powerful, squat snout, a gbahali viciously bites their quarry, while their powerful hind legs allow them to leap upon fleeing creatures or stride away to safety when threatened. Gbahalis are solitary creatures, splitting their time between the rivers that offer easy meals of fish and aquatic snakes and stalking the edges of the hunting territories of larger, meatier prey. Given the option, gbahalis much prefer warm-blooded food, but a hungry or injured gbahali remains near a river where it can more easily consume large fish, snakes, or even crocodiles until it's ready to hunt its preferred quarry once again. An adult gbahali can quickly take down and consume livestock, leaving no sign of its meals but enormous scuffed tracks in the ground, as its jaws are large enough to swallow many creatures whole. Gbahalis have a basic understanding of humanoid behavior. A gbahali learns quickly to evade trackers and traps, and can skillfully hunt along the fringes of a settlement for months before its presence becomes known. They usually avoid humanoid prey, even when hungry; they know that humanoid communities may hunt them in dogged retaliation for feasting upon a humanoid. Gbahalis therefore prefer to hunt far-ranging livestock like ranch or grazing animals. If another predator threatens a gbahali's territory, it might attack a humanoid, leave messy remains strewn about, and then retreat from the area for several weeks. In this time, it hopes the angry humanoids will hunt and kill its rival, leaving the gbahali an uncontested hunting ground when it returns.",,9
Geist,"A geist is an ever-shifting mass of black sack cloth, teeth, and mouths, folding in and out of itself and cackling like a thousand frenzied and doomed souls. Created when a haunt kills an evil person, a geist rises from a soul trapped on the plane of their demise, now connected to the dark energy radiating from haunts everywhere. They wander the world, looking for solace and never finding it. In frustration, they turn their malice back onto the living, antagonizing any nearby creatures, hoping to fatally lure their victims into the clutches of a haunt to be turned into another geist and share the torment. Geists are occasionally mistaken for other incorporeal undead, such as wraiths and ghosts, but their proximity to haunts is one of the surest ways to determine the nature of the undead being encountered.",,9
Gelatinous Cube,"Found underground or in dungeons, these quivering cubes of slime continuously scour their domain for food. The acid in their bodies is weak enough that many gelatinous cubes still contain the gear of their victims, as they’re unable to break them down.",Ooze,3
Gelugon,"Insectile ice devils are strategists and masterminds in Hell’s armies, using their superior intellect to strike against their enemies and spread Hell’s influence throughout the planes. An ice devil rarely breaks their solitary contemplation of strategy save to pursue a plan they have devised. They can be enticed otherwise only by an exchange of services to be determined at a later time, adding to the pieces they can play on the board. Occasionally, a mortal strategist of outstanding skill might amuse an ice devil enough for the gelugon to agree to a contest of strategy, typically a strategic board game like chess, to decide a dispute. In the unlikely event the devil loses such a contest, they inevitably go to great lengths to later obtain that mortal’s services for their own infernal ends.",Devil,13
Gennayn,"Gennayns are minor genies who often serve as emissaries and messengers for greater elemental beings. While many find purpose in this humble mission, their true calling and interest is in the arts. They often appear as miniature, athletic humanoids with wisps of elemental energy continually dissipating from their bodies. These elemental energies often reflect their emotions and attuned element. Gennayns are also fond of ostentatious rings, amulets, and armbands. Gennayns eagerly assist powerful beings who reward and treat them well, but they're just as quick to abandon those they consider boring, stingy, or abusive. Beings who destroy artwork or mistreat artists will earn their eternal wrath.",Genie,2
Ghaele,"Ghaeles are fiend-hunting knights of Elysium and champions of the freedom to take up arms against oppressors and other evils. Ghaeles rarely engage directly in mortal wars, but where fiends are involved they make an exception. A ghaele might assume the guise of a mortal to fight fiends alongside others, hoping to bolster morale and teach good tactics against such supernatural foes. Ghaeles serve various deities and empyreal lords of Elysium, though many have an affinity for Cayden Cailean in his capacity as a champion of freedom and defender of the downtrodden. Among azatas, ghaeles are generally the quickest to shift to violence as a method of solving problems, but even then they seek to minimize pain and suffering when they can.",Azata,13

Gholdako,"Cyclops necromancers created gholdakos untold ages ago by performing foul rituals over the corpses of their fellow cyclopes. Although these rituals varied through the history of Ghol-Gan, each involved the sacrifice of numerous humanoids whose blood was used to write the runes scribed upon a gholdako's linens. Rarely, a cyclops initiated their own transformation into a gholdako, scribing runes glimpsed from oracular visions and fevered dreams on their clothes or carving them into their bare flesh. Regardless of their origin, gholdakos are guardians, bound beyond death to protect a location, relic, or person—often the same thing they once defended in life. Despite their death and subsequent reanimation, gholdakos retain many of the quirks of living cyclopes, including their ceaseless hunger, volatile temper, single-mindedness, and great strength.",,10
Ghonhatine,"In transforming xulgaths, drow fleshwarpers sought not to create a new type of creature but to recapture a form of xulgath predecessor believed entirely vanished from Golarion.

Ghul,"Legends claim the gods banished a number of evil, greedy, and gluttonous genies to the Material Plane in the early days of creation. There, the genies transformed into the first ghuls, cruel undead that feast on the flesh of the living. The greedy and gluttonous nature of the first ghuls lives on, cursing them with an insatiable need to consume. Ghuls haunt trade routes, cemeteries, and other locations with good hiding places and a regular influx of travelers. From here, ghuls use their abilities to confuse and captivate passersby, luring them toward dens where ghuls can feast on unsuspecting flesh. Unlike a ghoul, a ghul doesn't devour corpses—only live prey.",,5
Giant Amoeba,"These blobs of nearly transparent protoplasm are identical in form and behavior to the microscopic creatures from which they have evolved, except their outlandish size makes them all the more dangerous. Unlike slimes, puddings, and other deadly oozes, giant amoebas have an outer membrane that contains their internal structures, making them more susceptible to slashing weapons than their amorphous kin. However, this membrane is also extremely flexible and permeable, allowing them to surround prey and absorb it, suffocating and slowly digesting it in the amoeba's acidic fluids.",Ooze,1
Giant Anaconda,"The monstrous giant anaconda is capable of swallowing whole creatures as big as horses—to say nothing of their riders.

A giant badger's claws are sharp and strong enough to carve tunnels from solid rock. They typically stand 4 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh 500 pounds.",Badger,2
Giant Bat,"While big bats are certainly not uncommon in dark caves and abandoned ruins and may instill fear in squeamish spelunkers, the so-called giant bat is a true monster, weighing well over 100 pounds and having a wingspan of nearly 15 feet. It primarily eats fruit and bugs, but can be incited to violence through fear or hunger. Giant bat attacks can quickly give rise to rumors of more dangerous monsters—many mistake these massive animals for some sort of demon or vampiric monster. But like other bats, giant bats are simply social and intelligent mammals. They are sometimes used as mounts by smaller humanoids, commonly those who hail from or dwell in mountainous or underground regions.",Bat,2

Giant Centipede,"Most giant centipedes (known as sewer centipedes when found in cities) nest in small groups but hunt alone when they seek out food. Attempts to domesticate giant centipedes for use as guardians or pets generally end poorly, but some tribes of goblins, kobolds, and mitflits have developed effective methods of utilizing these vermin as guardians. Other tribes and some humanoid societies roast and eat centipedes, often with pungent peppers as a savory delicacy, although care must be taken in preparing the meal to avoid tainting the flesh with the creature’s venom.",Centipede,-1

Giant Crab,"Crabs are scavenging crustaceans known for their hard shells and iconic sideways gait. They use their claws to defend themselves, hunt, and fight other crabs for territory. When confronted with threats from outside their species, most crabs prefer to flee, but when retreat isn't possible, they clamp on to their foes as tightly as they can.The statistics presented here represent giant crabs that live close to the water's surface. Crabs that live deeper underwater often exhibit more extreme adaptations to their environment. Crabs who live in the depths where little light reaches gain darkvision and cold resistance, and those adapted to the most hostile reaches of the deep sea can detect nearby creatures through subtle shifts in ocean currents.These skittering creatures are prized for their delicious meat, but their size makes them dangerous targets for harvesting.",Crab,2

They are not daunted by larger creatures, compelled by their instinct to eat as much as possible to sustain their growth.",Dragonfly,3
Giant Eagle,"No mere animals, giant eagles have a keen intellect and a strong sense of honor. As guardians of their mountain homes, giant eagles attempt to prevent the encroachment of civilization upon wild land and the predations of wicked humanoid settlements. Unlike ordinary eagles, which tend to be solitary creatures, giant eagles congregate within aeries holding up to a dozen members and work together to protect their domains. Giant eagles have wingspans up to 30 feet across and weigh up to 500 pounds. These impressive birds cannot be easily broken or cowed. A giant eagle may allow trusted terrestrial friends to ride it, but they invariably resist saddles, harnesses, or other equipment that might suggest they are mere beasts of burden rather than trusted companions. Giant eagles are long-lived and take debts and oaths very seriously, often remembering slights for years and remaining slow to forgive.",Eagle,3

Flaps of loose skin between their limbs catch the air to keep them aloft as they leap from greater heights. They can use this technique to escape prey or reach places that would be difficult to climb up to. The giant variety of flying squirrels dwell in the highest treetops. They're more likely to be in danger from airborne enemies than predators on the ground.",Squirrel,2

Giant Frilled Lizard,"Found in warm and tropical forests and savannas, these immense lizards are a deadly threat to the unsuspecting traveler. When they aren’t sleeping or stalking prey, giant frilled lizards bask in the sunlight for hours at a time. Explorers sometimes mistakenly think them related to dragons due to their large size, elaborate neck frills (which, when displayed in a show of aggression and dominance, can be mistaken for wings), and ferocious hissing vocalizations used to frighten away creatures too large to eat. A giant frilled lizard’s primary food sources are oversized arthropods and other invertebrates, but it won’t hesitate to augment its diet with vertebrates, including other lizards, monkeys, and just about anything it can flt into its mouth—even humanoids. Although capable of short bursts of speed, a giant frilled lizard normally lies perfectly still while hunting, hoping to ambush its prey.",Lizard,5
Giant Frog,"Giant frogs can grow up to 6 feet long and weigh over 200 pounds, with rows of razor-sharp teeth lining their gaping mouths.",Frog,1
Giant Gecko,"These roughly human-sized reptiles have amazing feet capable of clinging tenaciously to any surface. Giant geckos are typically docile and shy but can be aggressive when cornered or defending their territory. These large-eyed lizards are found in a wide variety of habitats, from rainforests and deserts to mountain slopes or even underground caverns. They spend most of their time climbing around in large trees or on rocky cliffs, whether hunting for small animals or hiding from predators. A giant gecko’s scales are often quite brightly colored or decorated in intricate patterns. Giant geckos span nearly 8 feet in length from head to tail, and they weigh about 120 pounds. Giant geckos are sometimes used by smaller humanoids as guardians or mounts, as their docile nature makes them relatively easy to tame and train. Their superior climbing skills make giant geckos particularly popular within societies that dwell underground or near cliffs, such as goblins and kobolds. Their bright coloration also makes them favorite exotic pets in high society.",Lizard,1

It can even squeeze its enormous bell-shaped body into the tight confines of shipwrecks to drape its mane of tentacles across the exposed flesh of its prey.",Jellyfish,7
Giant Leech,"Capable of growing to lengths of nearly 5 feet, giant leeches have circular maws filled with hook-like teeth.

Giant Mining Bee,"Giant mining bees have smaller bodies than giant worker bees but sometimes look larger due to their bristles, which resemble fur. They dig tunnels in sand, old wood, or stone to create nests and aggressively defend their lairs. Although not truly subterranean, giant mining bees are the most likely type of giant bees to be found underground, and some dwarf apiarists breed and train them.",Giant Bee,2
Giant Monitor Lizard,"Large and seemingly ponderous, a monitor lizard is a deceptively swift and ruthless predator. It ambushes its prey by rushing out from cover and biting the target with its powerful jaws. A giant monitor lizard’s saliva is venomous, allowing it to bring down prey larger than it can easily haul away in its jaws. Giant monitor lizards grow up to 14 feet long, including their long tails, and they weigh about 350 pounds. Their bodies are normally dark brown with patches of yellow or green. When nesting, a giant monitor lizard digs a deep burrow to hide in. The burrow serves as both a safe haven and a location from which the lizard can ambush larger prey such as deer, boars, or even humanoids. A giant monitor lizard can consume nearly its own body weight in a single meal, and its loosely articulated jaws allow it to swallow surprisingly large prey.",Lizard,2
Giant Moray Eel,"Giant moray eels dwell in warm, tropical waters and build lairs in narrow, twisting caves made of coral. Their size, speed, and powerful bite make them dangerous to divers and fishermen. Giant moray eels have rubbery hides that secrete a layer of mucus, making them difficult to harm with some weapons.",Eel,5

Giant Opossum,Larger species of opossum can eat nearly anything human-sized or smaller.,Opossum,2
Giant Pangolin,"Despite their prodigious size, giant pangolins are solitary, reclusive creatures who forage by night for insects and vermin. To defend themselves from predators, they rely on a veritable arsenal of natural defenses to dissuade their foes: thick armor of wickedly sharp scales, a flexible and muscular body capable of rolling into a defensive ball, and a noxious musk. Against more persistent threats, giant pangolins' powerful digging claws prove mighty weapons in a pinch. While a pangolin's defenses serve well against natural predators, they've long been targets of poaching by humanoid cultures, partly for meat, but largely due to the high value of their unique scales. These scales see widespread use in alchemy, folk medicine, and crafting, and thus demand for them—and the associated profits from their sale—remain high. Giant pangolins are better protected against humanoid hunters, but the larger size of their scales means wider applications and greater volume. The increased difficulty of acquiring pangolins makes doing so all the more profitable, and unscrupulous poachers can make a considerable living from hunting these creatures.",,4
Giant Porcupine,"The porcupine, sometimes called a quill pig, is a shy, gray-and-brown herbivore covered in barbed quills. Though most comfortable on the forest floor, a porcupine can climb trees adeptly to seek out leaves, bark, and insects for food. The giant porcupine is no less shy than its smaller kin, but these 5-foot-long specimens climb only the ancient old growth of deep forests. Both species are found only in temperate woodlands, though a giant porcupine prefers forests with less undergrowth where it can maneuver more easily. When startled or threatened, a porcupine employs multiple strategies to discourage potential predators. It emits a pungent odor that warns other creatures away, rattling its quills and chattering its teeth loudly to provide an additional auditory warning. If cornered, it raises its quills, faces away from the danger, and charges backwards at full speed, impaling any unlucky creatures is in its path. A porcupine's barbed quills—in actuality long, stiff hairs—hook into a foe's flesh. A creature can easily pull free from the porcupine should a creature come into contact with one, but the quill's barbed tips continue to dig into the victim's skin from the creature's own movements. Removing the quills is a painful process, and quills that break off under the skin can sometimes requires a healer's assistance to remove effectively. Contrary to popular belief, however, a porcupine can't shoot its quills, making it a threat only to a creature brazen or foolish enough to attack it directly. Porcupines use the same defensive tactics regardless of size, but the giant porcupine is often devastatingly effective given its sheer mass. Fortunately, these creatures tend to flee at the first opportunity to do so. The few attempts to train them as guardians have ended poorly for this reason, though some druids and other woodfolk have, on occasion, persuaded these creatures to accompany them as companions.",,2
Giant Rat,"Giant rats are enormous versions of the common vermin. They are typically found in abundant numbers, but since they cannot flt in the nooks where mundane rats typically hide, they are much easier to locate and exterminate. They mostly live in sewers where they can scavenge from the streets above, but some families of giant rats live in more remote locations, such as dank caves or forests and hills. Rats are incredibly adept survivors and can be found nearly anywhere in the world, though they tend to favor temperate or warm climates as opposed to cold regions. Although its bite alone is not lethal except to the very young or very old, the giant rat carries the filth fever common to rodents around the world—a pestilence more than capable of ravaging rural communities.",Rat,-1
Giant Scorpion,"These massive, terrifying arachnids are typically 8 feet long from head to the base of the tail. Giant scorpions are the favored pack animals and war beasts of various desert-dwelling monsters, particularly gnolls. They are most commonly encountered in the wild, however. There they lair in mountainside caves or burrow beneath shallow layers of sand where they lie in wait for prey to wander near. Sleek, pallid subterranean scorpions also exist, as do still larger species.",Scorpion,3
Giant Seahorse,"Giant seahorses are bear-sized, docile versions of their tiny, more common cousins. Merfolk and other underwater cultures often use them as pack animals, while some coastal cultures ride them as mounts. Earning a seahorse's trust can be rather difficult given their skittish nature, but giant seahorses can express incredible loyalty and affection once they bond with someone, even going so far as to risk their own well-beings to defend someone who has earned their trust. They don't take to combat naturally, though, and in dangerous situations, they're more likely to try and grab their rider with their strong, prehensile tails before swimming to safety, rather than staying in a fight. Like smaller seahorses, giant seahorses have bony armor plates on the outside of their bodies, covered by skin, which makes them fairly durable despite their reluctance to battle. Though not the strongest swimmers, seahorses rely primarily on natural camouflage to survive. Chromatophores in seahorses' skin allow them to camouflage themselves. This ability is fairly rudimentary, and the size of a giant seahorse makes this tactic far less effective for them than for their smaller kin. Their colors change slowly at most times, though when in a dangerous situation, the process occurs much more rapidly for the seahorse. Unlike regular seahorses, giant seahorses also rely on herd tactics for defense as well as their surprising physical strength. A herd of charging seahorses is just as terrifying and dangerous underwater as a herd of stampeding horses on land. Humanoids in underwater cultures learn at a young age to quickly get out of the way of a herd of stampeding seahorses. Baby giant seahorses are too big to easily float and lack sufficient strength to swim on their own for several weeks after birth. They instead link tails with an adult and allow themselves to be ferried around. An adult seahorse can carry upwards of 20 seahorse babies hanging from them at once, though these babies might occasionally get left behind or swept away by a strong current. Caring for these helpless, wayward children is seen as a supreme act of kindness by many merfolk, who'll let these babies wrap their tails around staves and other implements and rear them into adulthood.",,3
Giant Silverfish,"Some silverfish can grow as large as a pig, particularly in magic colleges and ancient vault-libraries, where they terrify hapless students and destroy precious tomes. Popular academic lore attributes their unusual size to a steady diet of spellbooks.",Silverfish,0

Giant Snapping Turtle,"If the regular-sized snapping turtle is foul-tempered, then the giant snapping turtle seems to be willfully violent toward anything that dares intrude upon its domain. Measuring over 20 feet long and weighing thousands of pounds, this creature is capable of swallowing a humanoid whole. Swamp-dwelling societies, particularly boggards and lizardfolk, have often tried to domesticate giant snapping turtles to serve as powerful guardians, but in most cases the casualties pile up quickly. Those unfortunate enough to be swallowed whole by a giant snapping turtle find that even the creature's stomach is somewhat armored, making it difficult to cut through.",Turtle,9
Giant Solifugid,The smallest of giant solifugids are still large enough to harry desert traders and their mounts.,Solifugid,1

Giant Stag Beetle,"The giant stag beetle is larger than a horse, and the sight of one flying (if slowly and somewhat clumsily) on great buzzing wings is unnerving. Its enormous mandibles are used to impress mates, intimidate rivals, and discourage predators, for they can deliver deadly blows. While giant stag beetles are deadly predators, they can be domesticated by skilled wranglers. In such a capacity, these beetles serve well as beasts of burden or even as mounts. Giant stag beetles can be a serious menace in marshes, cavern complexes, and heavy forests. More than one logging camp has attracted a cluster of giant stag beetles and had to be completely abandoned, yielding all its lumber to the hunger of the giant insects.",Beetle,4
Giant Tapir,"With a blunt, prehensile trunk and a squat posture, giant tapirs resemble a cross between elephant and boar, though they're actually more closely related to horses and rhinoceroses. Tapirs live in loose herds that graze near rivers and lakes. They enjoy fresh water, not only for the lush plants that grow along the shores—which they eat in prodigious quantities— but also for the protection the water provides. When predators approach, tapirs retreat to the water to hide, keeping their snouts barely above the surface to breathe. Likewise, the breezes and scents that accompany creeks and rivers mask tapirs' musk as they travel along these waterways. Despite their ungainly movement, tapirs are remarkably sure-footed, easily traversing mud and similar terrain thanks to their broad toes. Humanoids often hunt giant tapirs for their meat and durable hides. Such hunts are far from guaranteed, though; tapirs can run at least as fast as their hunters, and most will fight if cornered. The docile giants do what they can to avoid confrontation whenever possible. If they sense danger approaching, giant tapirs make a loud whistling sound to warn other tapirs about predators. A community who befriends or domesticates a herd of tapirs can use this whistling habit as an alarm system against encroaching enemies. Giant tapirs are usually quite placid, but they can be fearsome when roused. Their tusk-like front teeth are suitable for gouging attackers, and a tapir that manages to get a mouthful of an enemy's arm or leg can use its blunt molars to grind the flesh to paste. Tapirs have good hearing and an excellent sense of smell, but like many prey animals, they have poor vision. In the chaos of combat against multiple enemies, giant tapirs can become overwhelmed and confused, lashing out at allies as well as foes or fleeing the scene entirely.",,2

Giant Tick,This grotesque tick is the size of a dog and scurries with surprising speed.,Tick,1
Giant Toad,"Most giant toads live in dry environments, particularly deserts, and eagerly eat almost any creature smaller than themselves. They're known to eat giant rats, then take over the rats' burrows as homes. Giant toads have large poison glands behind their eyes that enable them to coat their skin with poison. This leads to them having very few natural predators, and populations can quickly explode if left unchecked. While most consider giant toads dangerous pests, some groups of ogres and hill giants cultivate them to collect their poison for recreational use.",Toad,2
Giant Tsetse Fly,"This blood-sucking fly, the size of a horse, is widely despised as a harbinger of disease. Giant tsetse flies rarely congregate in large numbers, as they require gallons of blood each day to survive and thus crowd out or drive away rivals. Any group of creatures large enough to sustain multiple tsetse flies, such as a herd of dinosaurs, are quite likely to dominate the surrounding ecosystem on their own right. A single giant tsetse fly can kill an entire herd of large animals within a few weeks, and those they don't kill often succumb to disease. When not hunting, giant tsetse flies prefer to hide in warm, dark places in forests and swamps, though they sometimes inhabit wet cave systems where prey is plentiful. The thrumming drone of their wings echoes around such cave systems, warning travelers familiar with the noise that the creatures are lairing nearby. If food becomes scarce, a giant tsetse fly relocates elsewhere. They tend to follow rivers, animal tracks, or even roads to find food. This can take them to the fringes of civilization, where farms and ranches often have livestock that draws their attention. Settlers who find evidence of a giant tsetse fly should quickly seek out help to eliminate the pests, as all their animals (and, indeed, their families) are in jeopardy as long as the hungry insect is near. Giant tsetse flies are only moderately smarter than ordinary flies, but some creatures have learned that they can train the creatures with frequent offerings of fresh blood. Giant tsetse flies might therefore be put to use as guardians or even mounts, but any potential trainer must take care not to become the voracious insect's next meal.",Fly,2
Giant Viper,"The giant viper’s fangs are a frightening sight, with injection tubes as long as daggers. The sheer amount of venom injected by a giant viper can cause severe blood clotting and leave a victim utterly drained of vitality.",Snake,2
Giant Vulture,"Recognizable at a distance by their black feathers and bald necks, vultures drift along air currents looking for carrion to serve as their next meal. Often grouping in committees of four or five, these scavengers wheel above battles and plague-stricken towns, eager to feed. This feeding cycle plays an important role, especially in hot regions, as their particularly potent stomach acid neutralizes dangerous bacteria in their meals and thus removes it from the environment. A giant vulture has a wingspan of up to 25 feet across and weighs up to 600 pounds. Less common than their smaller cousins, they typically live in areas that support a number of megafauna species. While imposing and certainly dangerous when provoked, even giant vultures are not hostile by nature, preferring to feast on the kills of others. They are more likely to vomit their last meal as a distraction while they flee than to attack other creatures. However, during particularly lean times, starving groups of giant vultures might work in unison to make a meal of livestock. Giant vultures occasionally form parasitic relationships with larger creatures such as dragons or giants, picking at the remains of an unattended or forgotten meal. Crafters who use bones in their work have come to value this type of behavior. Flensing a creature properly is far slower than letting a committee of vultures strip the carcass and leave behind a clean skeleton. As food-motivated predators, younger vultures raised this way can be made to imprint upon owners, leading to a trend of keeping them as unusual pets. While not magical in nature, vulture talons are traditionally used as charms in healing and removing disease, stemming from an old belief that the raptors were immune to the filth in which they strode. While this belief isn't strictly true, vultures do have several unique adaptations to avoid common diseases that would take out predators or even other scavengers. Due to their size, giant vulture talons in particular are sometimes used to craft weapons in regions where other resources are scarce.",,3

Giant Worker Bee,"Worker bees, exclusively female, exist to feed and defend a hive. They have no qualms about sacrificing their lives when confronting intruders in their territory. Worker bees can fight singly, in small groups, or in swarms of dozens. Giant worker bees inject a venom with their stings, but this venom is rarely dangerous except to people sensitive to it. Other worker bees have no stinger and only bite their enemies.",Giant Bee,0
Gibbering Mouther,"Amorphous blobs of yammering mouths and oozing, fleshy sludge, gibbering mouthers are among the strangest creatures found either aboveground or below. Perpetually ravenous, these aberrations are always seeking their next meals, ever eating but never sated. With a nominal intelligence, gibbering mouthers can understand and even speak Aklo, but they do so in an intelligible manner only rarely. Instead, their innumerable mouths constantly jabber and babble in a stream of sound that disrupts the thought patterns of other creatures in the area. Where, how, and why gibbering mouthers originated are questions without answers. They share certain similarities with the much more powerful shoggoths, leading to theories that the two creatures share an origin; less charitable scholars have suggested that the gibbering mouther is instead a mortal’s attempt to create something akin to a shoggoth—though the question of why remains unanswered. Still others believe gibbering mouthers were sent to the world by the gods as a punishment for some forgotten but surely terrible transgression. Gibbering mouthers themselves have little to say on the matter—at least, not in any sort of sense. Scholars have wasted countless hours in attempts to make sense of gibbering mouthers’ noises—studies that put researchers into danger and give results that are contradictory and confusing at best. Whatever their origin, gibbering mouthers range the entirety of Golarion. Sightings have been recorded in dungeons below ancient cities and ruins as well as many regions of the deeper Darklands layers of Sekamina and Orv. They are somewhat less common in the upper region of Nar-Voth, perhaps due to the prevalence of settlements that don’t tolerate gibbering mouthers’ presence.",,5

Gimmerling,"Gimmerlings are small, shapeshifting fey who stage ambushes to sate their endless hunger and childish greed. These cruelly curious fey obsess over finding and making unusual traps and sadistic weapons, and their favorite amusement is se eing these traps sprung or the weapons wielded. When on the Material Plane, they are frequently found in urban areas, particularly slums or other parts of town where they can either go unnoticed or be easily forgotten—and have plenty of victims to choose from. A typical gimmerling disguises itself as an endangered child, doing so in hopes of drawing creatures close enough to rob. The gimmerling puts itself in apparent danger using a trap, construct, or bribed ally, or even a coerced monster like a redcap. Because gimmerlings sometimes trade obscure smithing or trapping techniques in exchange for gifts that sate their curiosity, their greed, or their hunger, they have at times been worshipped as minor gods of the forge. Some disciplined gimmerlings work as honored artisans, elite guards, or spies for the demigods known as the Eldest who dwell in the depths of the First World.",,12
Girtablilu Seer,"The highest position of authority in a girtablilu community is the group's religious leader. This sacred duty requires years of study, meditation, and dedication to awaken a mystical font of divine magic within the girtablilu. These seers ensure that every action taken by the community falls in line with even the most obscure dogma of their tradition, and they don't hesitate to turn their fury on members of their own community who violate their mandates.",Girtablilu,12
Girtablilu Sentry,"Sentries patrol the outskirts of a girtablilu communities, watching for external threats like desert drakes, blue dragons, or adventuring parties set on reckless exploration of the girtablilus' sacred site.",Girtablilu,8
Glabrezu,"Glabrezus are looming behemoths who revel in the act of twisting mortal desires into their ultimate ruin, betraying and manipulating as easily as they breathe. Desires granted by a glabrezu always come to fruition in the most destructive way possible, turning a wish or hope into a potent and devastating act of betrayal—although the long-term repercussions are not always immediately apparent. For example, a struggling weapon smith might wish for fame and skill at their craft, only to find that their best patron is a cruel and sadistic murderer who uses the weapons in bloody sprees. Or a lonely widower might have his desire granted in the form of a lost love returned to “life” as a vampire. Glabrezus are nothing if not creative in addressing a mortal’s needs. These massive demons have enormous pincers and a pair of smaller humanoid arms sprouting from their chests, but their size belies their skill at magic, and they possess formidable innate spells. Treachery demons arise from the souls of mortals engaged in treason and deception.",Demon,13
Glass Golem,"Crafted of hardened glass and held together by magically treated lead, glass golems are both deadly guardians and works of exquisite art. Glass golems most often protect grand cathedrals or opulent palaces—testaments to the wealth and power of those they serve, or once served. Once spurred into action by the commands of their creators, glass golems are quicker and more agile than most other golems. Their sharp, blade-like limbs can easily sever veins and arteries, creating wounds that bleed profusely. Of all the various types of golems, the glass golem is the one most akin to a work of art. Just as powerful aristocrats might use an ice golem for temperature regulation or a wood golem as an ego-boosting statue, a glass golem's colorful glass construction can elevate the beauty of any chamber by its mere presence.",Golem,8
Gliminal,"Beholding the blinding light of a gliminal is akin to staring into the sun, and consequently, only gliminals themselves fully understand what they are or how they truly look. Gliminals exude a constant aura of positive energy, suffusing everything they encounter without regard for whether a creature's body can withstand these excesses of positive energy. On the Positive Energy Plane they call home, gliminals view outsiders as unfortunate creatures afflicted with the malady called mortality. They seek to suffuse mortals with light and healing until they no longer suffer, and they consider those who explode into positive energy cured. Gliminals pulled to other planes, whether summoned or through interplanar rifts, find themselves overwhelmed, and usually lash out in increasingly desperate attempts to escape the oppressive onslaught of matter and negative energies.",,9
Glimmervine,"Glimmervines are carnivorous creeping vines with sparkling white flowers that open to bloom only at night. They flourish most in high altitudes and cold climates, where they survive by dazzling small prey with their iridescent blossoms before crushing them to death with impossibly strong tendrils. The blood and decomposing flesh of their prey seep into the ground like fertilizer for glimmervines' roots to absorb as nutrients. Because scarps and gulleys caked with gore tend to deter future victims, glimmervines instinctively know not to linger in one spot for long. Glimmervines are mostly dormant during the day. Clinging to the sides of mountains and cliffs, they're easily mistaken for mundane climbing plants such as ivy or morning glory. When night falls, though, glimmervines' spectacular reflective flowers make their entrancing nature plain for all to see. Glimmervines are closely related to assassin vines, who employ similar ambush tactics and feeding behaviors, but the former is easily discernible by the shiny white blooms in place of an assassin vine's small red berries. These petals are coated with iridescent veins that absorb sunlight during the day and give off an eerie yet beautiful glow at night. The glistening patina attracts pollinating insects. On their own, glimmervines don't pose much of a threat to most creatures. Though its root-based sensory organs are formidable in close proximity, a glimmervine can't sense creatures farther than 60 feet away, making escape as easy as getting out of range of their slow movement. The true danger of these plants comes from glimmervine thickets—dense patches of glimmervines that can entangle entire hillsides or ravines. Woe be unto a hapless traveler caught in the midst of a glimmervine thicket at sundown.",,4
Globster,"The tide washes ashore all manner of detritus, from harmless seaweed and shells to the rotting corpses of massive aquatic creatures. The globster is often mistaken for such, and this assumption isn't entirely incorrect—these mindless oozing masses are composed of decaying sea creatures, half-digested and merged into a revolting, reeking heap of blubbery sludge. Though mindless, globsters are predators that seek out living quarry. They often huddle on the seafloor, where their own fetid mass attracts scavengers who swiftly become the ooze's next meal. When the tides wash these monsters ashore, they simply shift to hunting land-bound prey. Coastal communities usually notice the smell of a washed-up globster long before they see it. Those sent to investigate often mistake a globster for the carcass of a beached whale before getting too close and discovering the presumed corpse is very much alive and hungry. Sages once believed globsters were undead, undulating wads of rotting flesh driven to feed, but though mindless, they are very much alive. They are attracted to waterside refuse dumps and floating garbage scows and dimly aware enough to congregate where food is plentiful. Globsters consume living creatures but digest only a portion of them. The undigested dross accumulates within the globster as it becomes more and more bloated. They carry this fetid mass within their squelching bodies until instinct or injury provokes them to vomit forth a new globster to help devour everything nearby. A globster with enough dross to create a new globster automatically does so as a free action triggered upon taking damage. Treat any encounter with such a globster as though it were against two level 5 creatures, instead of just one. As far as scholars know, this is the only way these creatures can create more of their kind.",,5
Gluttonous Geode,"Gluttonous geodes form when natural forces crack open a geode that's steeped in elemental magic, causing a natural break that acts like a hinged jaw. Though seemingly unimportant and no larger than a common turtle, gluttonous geodes are bellicose and dogged in their pursuit of an enemy.","Elemental, Earth",1
Gluttonworm,"Akiton's gluttonworms share many features of Golarion's cave worms, yet these immense predators are their own distinct species. Gluttonworms “swim” through the vast deserts of Akiton, moving almost like whales through the ocean as they forage for their next meals.",,19
Glyptodon,"Glyptodons are enormous, armadillo-like megafauna that roam sandy riverbanks and ancient forests in search of their favorite foods, namely riparian grass and tender saplings. Surly and suspicious, glyptodons avoid predators not out of a defensive instinct—their armored hides protect them from most well-equipped carnivores—but rather because they simply prefer to be left alone to their placid foraging. Despite their great size, glyptodons can survive on surprisingly little food, and they'll eat just about anything. As a result, they're more likely to be encountered roaming across vast tundra or desert regions than other large herbivores, appearing as a single, lumbering hump against an otherwise-flat horizon. A glyptodon's scutes—the thick, bony plates of its carapace—grow in distinctive patterns and scar readily, making it easy for non-glyptodons to identify individual animals. Glyptodons have notoriously bad eyesight, even for prey animals, and rely on their sense of smell to get around and identify threats and each other. In combat, they primarily rely on their thick carapaces to protect them from attackers. Although southern merchants have occasionally attempted to create a glyptodon-mounted trading network, riding these giants is an exercise in frustration, as their rounded hides provide little purchase for humanoid riders' feet or saddles. However, some webbed-toed people of the plains, including bands of lizardfolk, have managed to maintain glyptodon mounts thanks to their strong, flexible, clawed feet. Other ancestries primarily view glyptodons as a source of meat and tough hides, the latter of which make for excellent impromptu shelters and river boats. When cornered, a glyptodon uses its powerful digging claws to scrape or scare away attackers. Glyptodons can use their tails to ward off smaller predators, but generally do so only as a last resort.",,5
Gnagrif,"Squat, surly, and perpetually covered in wet mud, gnagrifs are gremlins that infest and destroy homes. They possess sharklike faces and two sets of jaws, allowing them to open their mouths 180 degrees and clamp onto flat rocks and walls. They delight in keeping their presence hidden, chewing holes into walls and foundations that weaken structures but don't bring them down until their inhabitants slam their doors too hard or step in the wrong place. Soon as the unwitting victims spring the trap, the building collapses around them. Like all fey, gnagrifs detest iron. Gnagrifs become obsessively vengeful if they accidentally swallow an iron nail or hinge, terrorizing families or whole villages for generations over the slight.",Gremlin,2
Gnoll Cultist,"Gnoll cultists serve as their clans’ spiritual guides and conduits to the divine. As often as not, their influence drives entire gnoll civilizations to commit atrocious acts of violence and enslavement. Lamashtu and Rovagug are favored deities of gnoll cultists, and many gnolls believe their kind was in fact birthed from the womb of the Mother of Monsters. Some gnoll clans worship lesser-known demon lords or entire pantheons of sinister patrons.",Gnoll,3
Gnoll Hunter,"Gnoll hunters serve their clans by hunting for food in the wilds, marauding along well-traveled roads, and tracking down escaped slaves.",Gnoll,2
Gnoll Sergeant,"When gnolls band together to form hunting or raiding parties, the strongest among them is often designated the leader or sergeant. These gnolls train extensively in the art of war. Their skill at arms and the respect they command make them powerful adversaries. In smaller clans or single family units, a gnoll sergeant might also serve as the group’s leader in other affairs, such as sorting out domestic disputes or negotiating with rival gnoll clans.",Gnoll,4

Most shirk their responsibilities in favor of wading into the fray and claiming more glory from their tribe-mates.",Goblin,1
Goblin Dog,"Goblins’ eponymous pets aren’t true canines at all, but rather large, blunt-nosed rodents with thin bodies and long legs. As cowardly as they are ugly, goblin dogs prefer to lurk behind bushes or in deep shadows, pouncing upon lone or wounded prey. Goblin dogs frequently lair and roam in packs, but they are likely to flee from a fight if injured, even if it means abandoning their pack-mates. Goblin dogs take their name from their long association with goblins, who breed the beasts as guard animals and mounts. Most goblins take issue with the name, as the average goblin is appalled at the suggestion that these, their favored mounts, have anything at all to do with actual dogs. Of course, being goblins, they haven’t bothered to come up with their own, unique name for goblin dogs. Even the most pampered goblin dogs have itchy mange and prolific dander that tenaciously affects those who come in contact with them. This “goblin pox” causes itchy hives and festering sores that are as unsightly as they are irritating and distracting. Goblin dog dander causes allergic reactions in nearly all other creatures that don’t share the goblin dogs’ terrible hygiene—with the notable exception, of course, of goblins, who remain entirely immune to the disease regardless of cleanliness. Hunger can drive goblin dogs to bouts of uncharacteristic violence; many goblins purposefully starve their pets to make them more aggressive in battle. Goblin dogs subsist on whatever organic material they can scavenge, and they particularly enjoy fresh carrion. Although goblins are far from picky eaters, they value goblin dogs as pets because the noisome animals will consume food that even goblins won’t dare to eat. “Will it eat?” is one of several games goblins enjoy playing with their goblin dog pets, where a wide range of mouth-sized morsels (not always edible or safe to consume) are dangled before a goblin dog’s snout. “Will it die?” is often a game played after “Will it eat?” Goblin dogs who survive the second game earn renown for their digestive prowess and often become favored tribal pets treated better than most of the rank-and-file goblins.",,1
Goblin Pyro,"Some goblins take their people’s admiration of fire fully into the realm of deadly obsession. These pyromaniacs can be a great boon to a band of goblin raiders eager to torch their enemies and wreak havoc. More often, however, their presence is a double-edged sword; in the heat of the moment, goblin pyros sometimes lose sight of their tribe’s goals and simply set fire to anything that will burn—including their own allies.",Goblin,1
Goblin War Chanter,"While all goblins enjoy singing, goblin war chanters pride themselves on mastering the art of vocal performance. Their ballads and jingles are undeniably catchy, though whether they are actually enjoyable is entirely subjective.",Goblin,1
Goblin Warrior,The frontline fighters of goblin tribes prefer to fight in large groups—especially when they can outnumber their foes at least three to one.,Goblin,-1
Gogiteth,"A gogiteth is a slavering nightmare of teeth, eyes, and hairy spiderlike legs, and its appearance is invariably seared into the minds of any who witness it. Hives of these skittering monsters haunt the lowest reaches of the Darklands, competing with cave worms and other subterranean horrors for food and resources. A gogiteth is rarely seen alone, as these oversized vermin learned long ago that the best means of survival is sticking close to others of their own kind. Even the haughty drow know to seek cover when a gogiteth is spotted, for where there is one, a swarm is sure to follow. Gogiteths make a clacking sound as they move about. The joints in their many legs pop and crack with each movement, though they can suppress this sound voluntarily so that they can hunt without giving away their presence. The odd creatures can also make a high-pitched whistling sound that echoes throughout the caverns where they live. Some Darklands natives report that groups of gogiteths sometimes join together in eerie, discordant songs. Gogiteths’ alien anatomies have inspired no shortage of speculative origin stories. Some believe they are the result of a fleshwarping experiment gone horribly wrong. Others think they may be related in some way to the Dominion of the Black—possibly the distant cousins or some strange exile of that alien entity; according to this mythos, once they made their way to this planet, the gogiteths crawled into the depths of the earth, shying away from the blazing sun above. Gogiteths are a menace to every other denizen of the Darklands. Drow and duergars in gogiteth-infested regions of Sekamina or Orv frequently organize hunting parties to eradicate the terrors, even calling for temporary truces with unlikely allies in times when a gogiteth presence must be addressed. Since even an average gogiteth hive can host up to two dozen of the horrors, missions to eradicate them when they become established are dangerous quests indeed.",,12
Golgopo,"As their empire crumbled and fell into ruin, many cyclopes turned to increasingly depraved and vicious rituals to enhance their divinations and oracular powers. Some, especially those too fearful or suspicious of their fellow cyclopes to collaborate, constructed servants known as golgopos to aid in their rituals. These squat creatures are made from ancient bones dredged from fetid swamps and packed with mud to resemble a squat humanoid. Their heads are little more than the skull of whatever creature's bones were used in their creation with an extra eye socket punched in the forehead, glowing with eerie light. Golgopos spend most of their time perched on the shoulder of a cyclops master, acting as secondary casters for foul rituals and casting spells to aid them as needed. Golgopos are generally not evil, however, and one whose master has abandoned them or been destroyed might be convinced to employ their knowledge of ritual magic in service of another.",,8
Goliath Spider,"Goliath spiders dwell in the deepest jungles, where they build webs as big as temples and feast on prey as large as hippopotami.",Spider,11
Gorgon,"Though they may resemble constructs to the untrained eye due to their metallic, interlocking armor plates that look and feel like polished stone, gorgons are a creature of flesh and bone. These ill-tempered beasts greet interlopers with a charge or trample accompanied with belches of petrifying breath. Gorgons are dangerous on their own, and when they band together in herds, they become especially deadly. Gorgons typically subsist on petrified flesh or fossils. These supernatural beasts can gain sustenance from natural stone if they must, though they find raw stone flavorless, so it's not a preferred food source. In battle, gorgons use their petrifying breath to turn their prey into stone. They break up the resulting statues with their hooves or horns and swallow the stony chunks with loud chewing bites. Gorgons cannot digest unpetrified organic material, and if they try, they experience sickness and great gastrointestinal peril. Such discomforts are not life threatening to gorgons, but they do make the creatures even more ill tempered than usual—much to the chagrin of anyone they subsequently encounter. Gorgon flesh tastes vaguely like beef, but with a gritty, earthy texture and aftertaste that most meat connoisseurs find off-putting. Creatures with a close association to earth and stone are more likely to find the flavor appetizing; stone giants in particular consider gorgon steaks to be delicacies. Some cultures, notably dwarven cultures, consider the preparation of gorgon for meals as both a physical and a culinary challenge. Chefs who work with gorgon flesh can find renown for their skill in creating palatable dishes from such naturally unpalatable meat.",,8
Gorilla,"Gorillas can be territorial creatures, particularly if provoked by hunters or the presence of more dangerous monsters. A gorilla uses its fangs and powerful arms to bite and pummel trespassers with wild abandon.",Ape,3
Gosreg,"Gosregs are agents of the Dominion of the Black that insinuate themselves into humanoid societies to foster the goals of their sinister alien masters. They act as spies and special forces that can mingle with humanoid society while enacting plans for the rest of the Dominion in secret. In their natural forms, gosregs dart about in a jerky gallop due to their stumpy legs and gangly arms. They take on the appearances of humanoids to infiltrate societies, and they drop their disguises only when they feel they are ultimately compromised and must resort to physical violence to protect their agendas. Their brain-like heads and bestial legs suggest a potential link with a similar Dominion of the Black agent: the dreaded intellect devourer.",,11
Gourd Leshy,"Gourd leshys are guardians of fields, gardens, and farms. Many villages benefit from the protection of a gourd leshy, even if they are unaware of it.",Leshy,1
Granite Glyptodont,"This squat and stony creature looks like an armadillo with a large raised back and a flail-like tail. The granite glyptodont has no true need to feed, as with all elementals, yet it does seem to linger after transforming the flesh of those it calcifies, as if the mere proximity of flesh fossilizing into stone pleases it somehow.","Elemental, Earth",8
Grappling Spirit,"When a great gladiator or wrestler meets their demise, their soul can sometimes linger out of a love for combat and sport. Every grappling spirit manifests a mask that represents the legacy of the warrior they were during their life.",,9
Grauladon,"Grauladons are vicious predators that appear crocodilian in form, but are in fact distant offshoots of dragonkind. They make their dens in the shallows of fetid ponds or isolated corners of larger bodies of water, usually in rural swamps or woodlands. Driven almost entirely by their base desire to feed, grauladons spend most of their time swimming leisurely underwater looking for prey such as fish or waterfowl. Possessed of a greed befitting their more majestic dragon cousins, grauladons often take down prey larger than they need, jealously guarding the corpses to keep scavengers away even as the meat rots. A typical grauladon is 16 feet long from its snout to the tip of its tail and weighs 1,500 pounds. A grauladon’s stench may seem supernaturally disgusting, but it is simply the result of the creature’s fetid habitat and diet of rotting, waterlogged meat. As grauladons’ exhalations bear a passing resemblance to dragons’ breath, they have earned the nickname “mud drakes” from rural folk. Grauladons can be found in both fresh and brackish water in most temperate climates. They prefer to lair in shallow waters, particularly where reeds or other foliage conceal their bulk from unsuspecting prey. Grauladons are highly territorial and won’t tolerate other predators living or hunting near their homes.",,2
Grave Hag,"Rot-skinned grave hags usually lair in cemeteries, mausoleums, and other burial sites; unlike most hags, they can't alter their appearance into a comely shape, so they hide from most observers. Grave hags consider such a predatory life hiding out in graveyards to be pitiful and squalid—they prefer to dwell in lands where necromancy is common and undeath isn't unusual. These grave hags become adept at necromantic magic and love posing as scholars. Schemers and plotters, they surround themselves with minions whom they send on missions to collect corpses for ghastly rituals.",Hag,9
Grave Robber,"Many cultures have a tradition of burying their dead with a selection of the deceased's most precious possessions, and some include gifts that are thought to provide a boon in the afterlife. Such valuables can be easy pickings for those with no respect for—or fear of—the dead.",Criminals,1

Graveshell,"The graveshell is a dangerous predator that draws scavengers and explorers into its grasp using a morbid lure: the corpse of a former victim impaled upon the spikes that protrude from its large, turtle-like shell. Aside from its shell, the monster resembles no known animal. Small but bright yellow eyes watch from the sagging flesh of its head, the most prominent feature of which is a curiously shaped, toothy maw twisted into a perpetual grin. Its stubby arms and legs are impractical for both walking and swimming, though the algae-caked claws tipping each limb are deadly weapons. Graveshells are intelligent—a fact that surprises many who encounter them—and surrender rather than fight to the death. These monsters have little to offer in exchange for their lives, though the waterlogged treasures on their collection of corpses may entice opportunists.",,1
Gray Ooze,"These dangerous oozes are the bane of any who travel through swamps, marshes, or damp caves. Easily masquerading as pools of clear water or patches of wet stone, gray oozes lie in wait for unwary victims to reach down for a drink or step into what appears to be a puddle, then lash out with whiplike pseudopods to ensnare and consume their hapless prey.",Ooze,4
Great Cyclops,"Gigantic, dim-witted loners, the great cyclopes embody their lesser kin writ large. They are both stronger and more violent, but their uncontrolled vision into possible futures has driven them beyond reason. They see every moment as a potential storm of uncontrollable fury, and out of a desperate desire for peace, quiet, and an end to their hunger, they lash out at all who come near. Wise creatures avoid great cyclopes at all cost. Debate has long raged over the origins of these massive, destructive giants. They are so large that it had long been assumed they were used as beasts of burden by their lesser kin, but they are now free to hunt and kill without restraint. Other scholars believe the great cyclops is the ultimate fate of the entire cyclops species. Whatever foolish decision or wayward curse caused the end of their civilization is still playing out, occasionally causing a cyclops to withdraw from its own kind, lose all semblance of intellect, and mutate into a lumbering, feral colossus. It is fortunate indeed that the great cyclops prefers to dwell far from humanoid settlements, because its immeasurable bloodlust inspires it to destroy virtually anything that moves, from dinosaurs and other monsters to the occasional explorer or soon-to-be-lost caravan.",Cyclops,12

Greater Barghest,"Once a barghest has eaten enough to grow into a greater barghest, it typically seeks a method to leave the Material Plane and return to the Abyss, there joining other fiends as yet another of that plane’s horrors. As barghests have no innate ability to travel the planes, though, the time it takes for most greater barghests to engineer such a return can usually be measured in years, if not decades. During that time, greater barghests continue to play the roles of gluttons, hunters of humanity, and tyrants of goblinoid tribes. More than a few grow accustomed to such lives on the Material Plane and wholly abandon the end goal of returning to the Abyss, despite the fact that those who do make such a return home often grow even more powerful over time, gaining eerie new abilities and qualities absorbed from the raw chaos of the Abyss itself. In addition to greater barghests being more powerful than typical barghests, the process of transforming into a greater barghest results in hideous mutations that often grant deadly abilities. Some barghests grow large bat-like wings upon their transformation. Others develop toxic breath or vestigial limbs. The options detailed in the stats below represent only the tip of the proverbial iceberg for barghest mutations—feel free to use these as inspiration for coming up with new mutations of your own design.",Barghest,7

Green Hag,"Green hags hate beauty and purity, so they use disguises and treachery to lure and murder innocents, corrupt the pure of heart, and shatter the minds and morals of their victims. Green hags create imaginative schemes to utterly ruin anyone who crosses them, as well as good or righteous folk whose very existence insults the hag’s twisted sensibilities. The complicated scandals perpetuated by green hags involve impersonation, mistaken identity, the seduction and betrayal of loved ones, or all these things in combination.",Hag,4
Green Man,"Green men are ancient, enigmatic lesser deities of the primeval forests, living embodiments of nature and plantkind. When a forest or other woodland terrain generates enough nature spirits, beings of the same sort of vital essence that embodies leshy or answers the call of a commune with nature, they naturally coalesce together and apotheosize into a green man. Green men aren't concerned with all the multifarious processes of nature like Gozreh or many other nature deities. Instead, they focus nearly all their attention on the plants of their home, only concerning themselves with animals, minerals, and the like insomuch as they affect the plants. Despite their name, green men aren't necessarily male; as creatures of pure natural power, to many of them, the concept of gender holds no meaning, and to those that do, they can be of any gender. Most green men are neutral and tend to ignore “animals,” which to them include sapient creatures such as humans. However, good and evil green men do exist. These individuals are far more likely to attempt to spread their influence far and wide, either for good or ill. Good green men provide succor to all that come within their home, not only to plants, providing wisdom like a nurturing parent. Evil green men, however, allow rare and dangerous plants to thrive in their domains by spreading fear and devastation to all those who might threaten plant life, though they might keep a few animals around to hunt for sport.",,24
Green Monkey,"Nimble spirit guides are small and discreet, using their diminutive size and natural agility to dart from hiding place to hiding place. They tend to be much shyer than other spirit guides, at least initially, preferring to watch nearby mortals from a distance before deciding whether to trust them. When their trust is so earned, nimble spirit guides are often playful and contagiously exuberant. These spirit guides can often be found entertaining lost children with antics until they are rescued or freeing prisoners by stealing keys and picking locks. The green monkey is a nimble spirit guide who takes the appearance of a tiny primate with green fur that, on closer inspection, turns out to be fine blades of grass.",Spirit Guide,3
Griffon,"Griffons are regal beasts revered as symbols of freedom and strength in many cultures. They are physically striking, with the hindquarters of a lion and the head, wings, and forelimbs of a great bird of prey—typically an eagle, but some instead bear the features of a hawk, falcon, or even osprey or vulture. In rare cases, the griffon’s hindquarters may resemble those of a different great cat, such as a leopard or tiger. The variations seem to conform to the environment in which the griffon lives—for instance, the especially rare griffons of northern Avistan have the hindquarters of a Grungir lynx and the upper body of a snowy owl—though this is not always the case. Some griffons lack wings altogether. These wingless griffons, known as alces, result from a rare mutation. Among a clutch of other griffons, the alce is typically considered the runt, so few of these offshoots survive their fledgling stage. Those alces that do make it to adulthood tend to be tougher, more violent, and more aloof than most griffons. Wild griffons rely on their powerful wings to hold them aloft and their keen eyesight to spy out prey. The speed with which they plunge toward the ground and grab up their victims is shocking. They may tear open victim’s flesh with their razor-sharp beaks, but usually just take their prey to a high, secluded location where they can enjoy their feast without interruptions. On the ground, they take cover and leap out to ambush prey, then fly off with their prize. The exception to this is when a griffon is hunting to feed its offspring, in which case it will almost never purposefully bring a living creature back to its nest for fear of endangering its chicks. Skilled animal trainers long ago learned how to raise griffons as mounts for military forces or powerful individuals. Such mounts are known for their strength, bravery, and unfailing loyalty. They are among the smartest of animals and possess a wisdom not normally afforded most animals; it is thought that a griffon chooses its rider as much as a rider chooses the griffon. The process of training a griffon to accept and carry a rider in flight is a long and expensive ordeal. Griffon trainers charge rich sums for their services, and a ruler who can boast of owning a stable of griffons is the subject of great respect and envy.",,4
Grig,"Grigs are kindly musicians of the fey, often getting themselves into trouble due to their penchant for confronting evil well beyond their ability to vanquish. Even so, they fight bravely and with great cunning, using their magic and ranged sonic attacks while flying and leaping using their wings and powerful cricket-like lower torsos to stay out of reach.",Sprite,1
Grikkitog,"Grikkitogs, also known as “hungry earth,” are strange parasites from the Plane of Earth that infest and possess earth, rock, and stone in order to feed their endless hunger. A young grikkitog is a formless apparition until it corrupts an earth elemental host, forming the grikkitog’s core. A grikkitog can then infest the earth and stone nearby with its voracious essence, forming maws and eyes all around it. These creatures are particularly dangerous to small creatures that lair within gaps and holes among rocks, as well as mountain climbers searching for the perfect handhold.",,14
Grimple,"Even more than most gremlins, grimples resent the trappings of civilization: inn common rooms with their rowdy singalongs, livery yards with their whinnying horses, church steeples with their clanging bells. Grimples live to spoil these conventions, dropping tavern signs on patrons, urinating in rain barrels, and opening stable doors. When all else fails, they literally vomit their disdain on passersby. Grimples resemble humanoid, mange-ridden opossums, with boar-like tusks that aid them in rooting through garbage heaps for food. They are agile climbers who glide from eave to eave on the loose flaps of skin between their limbs. Savvy gremlin-hunters know to look for the skin flakes and fur grimples shed from their parasite-infested hides.",Gremlin,-1
Grimstalker,"These violently murderous fey have one purpose: to stealthily hunt down and slay humanoids brazen enough to dare set foot in the wilderness. Though they prefer to hunt from the shadows, grimstalkers do not fear taking their grisly work to the very edges of civilization. This boldness serves as a reminder that nature can be cruel, capricious, and owes no debt to humanity. Grimstalkers are happy to perform nature's dirty work and particularly enjoy targeting loggers, hunters, and explorers, regardless of whether they respect the natural setting they work or travel within. Grimstalkers are gaunt and hairless, and their mottled, green and brown flesh gives them the appearance of moss-draped bark. When damaged, they bleed a thick, sap-like blood. They mark their territories by lopping off the heads of their victims and stringing them up in the surrounding trees, a practice that often lures dangerous scavengers into their lands. Carnivorous and thorny plants are often found in wilds where grimstalkers dwell, filling roles that pets might in human society, though grimstalkers tend to treat these “pets” poorly at best. There are few accounts of grimstalkers working with other fey—for the most part, grimstalkers see their kin from the First World as cowards or weaklings, or perhaps both. Even notoriously violent fey such as redcaps shy from them, as grimstalkers consider their own kind the only company worth keeping. Grimstalkers hunt in small bands, using stealth to approach their targets. They surround enemies first, then work to unnerve them by knocking on trees or howling out threats in Aklo to distract and panic their quarry. Of course, a band of grimstalkers won't stay together for long, quickly succumbing to bickering and infighting. These violent arguments are common pastimes among grimstalkers, often ending with each grimstalker going its own way. Not even the presence of more powerful fey or commanding creatures can keep grimstalkers from their predisposed bickering. Some scholars theorize that this quality speaks to an ancient curse that once afflicted fey who were judged too cantankerous, but in truth, it's just part of what makes a grimstalker what it is: ill-tempered, confrontational, and bitter.",,5
Grindylow,"The top half of a grindylow looks vaguely like that of a goblin, but from the waist down, their bodies split into a tangle of suckered, wriggling tentacles. They dwell mostly in shallow waters both fresh and briny, including lakes, rivers, coastal regions, and near coral reefs. Grindylows generally organize into schools ranging from a few individuals to a few hundred. Smaller schools can sometimes be brought under the leadership of a powerful aquatic creature, though such alliances last only until the school faces a major setback, at which point the surviving grindylows scatter and form smaller schools of their own. Grindylows aren't territorial, but they are pragmatic; while they rarely build permanent structures, they will adopt a good hunting ground for generations until driven away by predators. They often lair in mobile shelters, such as a sargasso of seaweed or the hull of an abandoned ship. They are skilled scavengers and hunters that eat anything they can sink their teeth into. Grindylows respect the power of bigger sea predators but have a special hatred for squids (or anything they believe looks like a squid). Sailors plying grindylow-infested waters often paint the images of squids on the bottoms of their hulls in hopes of warding the little terrors off. While this can keep smaller schools at bay, it can also backfire, potentially inciting larger groups to gather for a coordinated attack; this becomes especially more likely if the ship's route becomes predictable. This hatred of squids does not extend to other tentacled creatures; grindylows consider octopuses to be the epitome of grace and power.",,0
Grioth Cultist,"Grioth cultists represent the lowest tier of their remorseless cult—worshippers of the Elder Mythos tasked with leading scouting missions into new worlds. Though ranked above scouts in the chain of command, they occupy a lowly place in the overall religious hierarchy. Though whispered rumors describe the legendary rituals needed to wrench worlds from their suns, these cultists don't learn this potent magic. Such secrets are left to grioth high priests, who are always the last to arrive in a colonized world. Most grioths worship the Outer God Nyarlathotep in one of his many incarnations, although some worship other entities of the Elder Mythos such as Azathoth, Nhimbaloth, or Yog-Sothoth. In the highly rare cases where a grioth is cut off from their society and given the opportunity to explore other religions, they still lean into faiths associated with the stars or the night, such as Desna or Zon-Kuthon. However, these grioths are loathed by others of their own kind, who view them as dangerous heretics.",Grioth,3
Grioth Scout,"The first grioths encountered on a new world are scouts. Typically traveling the vastness of space via one-way portals from their home worlds, grioth scouts never expect to see their homes again, as grioth leadership ensures true devotion to the colonization effort by stranding them on new worlds.",Grioth,1

Grippli Greenspeaker,The unofficial healers of gripplikind are known as greenspeakers.,Grippli,5
Grippli Jinxer,"Baneback gripplis with innate magical ability may find themselves drawn to vile magic dealing with poison, vermin, and ill luck. Those who revel in the dreadful legends surrounding their kind often worship evil gods or demons associated with poison, tattooing themselves with mystic symbols to gain powerful control over toxins.",Grippli,6

Grizzly Bear,"This large and powerful omnivore inhabits forested hills. While it typically sustains itself on nuts, berries, fish, and small mammals, it’s fiercely territorial and will chase off or kill any creature it views as competition. Grizzly bears are especially temperamental when their young are nearby. In combat, a grizzly bear often attempts to grab and maul its foe with surprising ferocity. It continues its assault until its foe seems like it is no longer a threat, though if the bear is hungry, it will not hesitate to feed.",Bear,3
Grodair,"Grodairs are bizarre fishlike creature native to the First World. Their supernatural physiology includes a strange organ with an extradimensional space capable of storing thousands of gallons of water. This grants grodairs the ability to create a suitable environment for themselves anywhere by releasing the water, quickly transforming any surrounding land into a shallow bog. When grodairs wish to leave for a new location, they simply suck up all the water back up. When necessary, grodairs can also travel on land by walking upon the tangle of long, fleshy tentacles that dangle from their bellies. Grodairs have two sets of eyes that function independently. While this makes the creatures difficult to surprise, it also makes them easy to distract. During conversations, they have a tendency to lose focus quickly and have difficulty remembering things. Still, they are avid conversationalists and enjoy hearing tales about the world. While this quality makes grodairs quite likable, they aren't reliable. They have difficulty following plans or schedules, and they can keep a secret only if they happen to forget it first. For these reasons, grodairs don't always make the best allies. Grodairs are voracious and curious omnivores who love trying new foods—in fact, the pursuit of new and interesting food is the most common reason that they venture out of First World. They can also capture and store within their throats any small animals and plants easily suspended in water, and eject them for consumption at a later time.",,5
Groplit,"The groplit is a squat little animal shaped like a water droplet, with a bulbous rear end and an eel-like face that juts from a narrow skull. Its rear legs are more muscular than those in front, which it primarily uses for balance, giving it the gait and appearance of a toad. Groplits are best known for their greasy skin and queasy hygienic habits: they spend most of each day using their two long tongues to slurp up their own oily excretions or similarly viscous discharge originating from plants or other animals. Although they prefer to dwell in northern wetlands, fens, and moist caves, groplits can thrive in all but the most barren environments. They'll eat just about anything, though they tend to prefer small, crunchy animals like bugs and birds. Groplits are famously loyal and highly sociable companions, and they make for dedicated, if somewhat odd-looking, pets. They can be taught simple commands and appear to take great pride in obeying them, performing stunts even in the face of obvious danger. An unscrupulous master might train a groplit with the intent to sacrifice it in an emergency, a fate to which the groplit is happily resigned. This single-minded obedience and their slow reproductive rate make groplits fairly rare in the wild. As a result of the way their bones are structured, groplits exhibit an imperturbable smile, of sorts—a physical feature which some find as creepy (or enraging) as others find it endearing. Its apparently ceaseless jubilation has given this creature the nickname “the grinning toad” in some parts of the world. Because they love to lap up oily matter of all kinds, groplits are naturally drawn to greasy animals like slurks, giant slugs, and lagofirs. For the most part, such animals rarely mind the company of an amiable groplit, though there's no such thing as a free meal; groplits who drop their guard amid their found family often end up on the wrong side of their companions' intestinal tracts.",,0
Grothlut,"Sluglike abominations, grothluts are fleshwarps that were once humans. While their head and torsos are vaguely human, their arms are rubbery and move awkwardly at their sides. Wretched creatures, they moan piteously when other creatures are near, perhaps as the last remnants of their shattered human consciousness pleads to be free from their horrid warped form. Many fleshwarpers consider the grothlut to be a failure of a creation, as the transformation all but stamps out the human consciousness. Others disagree, arguing that warping the creature’s mind makes it all the more useful, since its stupidity makes it pliable and easy to herd. Drow typically use grothluts as guardians that slowly patrol the edges of their enclaves. Once in position, grothluts can be used as crude shock troops, unleashed to soften enemy forces before more-valuable warriors wade in and cut down the enemies who have been nauseated by the grothluts’ exploded organs and flesh.",Fleshwarp,3
Guard,"Guards are rank-and-file members of a town watch or city guard, trained to look for trouble, take down criminals, and follow orders. They are a match for only the most fledgling of adventurers and criminals, but, given time, the settlement can usually muster them in numbers sufficient to neutralize most threats.",Officers,1
Guard Dog,"The typical guard dog is loyal to and beloved by many communities. Often adored as pets, they also excel as protectors and trackers, and can be fearless when defending a beloved master or family member. The statistics presented below work well for any number of breeds of dog ranging from 20 to 50 pounds in weight. Wild dogs can also use these statistics, but their untamed nature makes them far more unpredictable and threatening. Feral dogs are perhaps even more dangerous, for unlike their wild cousins, feral dogs often lack the instinctual fear of humanity that stops wild creatures from interacting with people.",Dog,-1
Guardian Aluum,"Aluum are metal and stone constructs created by the Pactmasters to aid in maintaining order in Katapesh. Each aluum can be controlled by a magical aluum charm, including the more powerful aluums that serve the favored agents of the Pactmasters as guardians. One such aluum attends Usilket at all times, unless he passes his guardian aluum charm to a PC to allow them the protection the construct affords.",Aluum,13
Guardian Naga,"The opposite of dark nagas in many ways, guardian nagas are benevolent and wise protectors of places of great natural or supernatural significance: ancient oak groves, forgotten holy temples, and vaults of sacred power are just a few examples of locations that these nagas protect. Guardian nagas believe that the beautiful elements of the cosmos are worthy of protection and that devotion to such a grand effort is its own reward. A guardian naga may join a group with similar values, such as a sect of priests or monks, to aid it in its holy endeavors and to exchange knowledge of the heavens. Guardian nagas usually encourage their young, upon reaching adulthood, to depart the nest and seek out their own natural wonders or ancient ruins to protect. Sometimes generations of guardian nagas might guard the same place, passing the honor of such care from parent to child. In such cases, the parent nagas aim to have at least one of their children elect to stay behind and become the guardian of their ancestral ward, giving the parents the peace of mind that the site they protect will continue to be guarded by their descendants. It is difficult for many societies that vilify serpents or see them as symbols of evil to accept the fact that guardian nagas are benevolent and kindly. Fortunately for these people, guardian nagas are also patient and understanding, and see encounters with such societies as opportunities to educate and expand worldviews.",Naga,10
Guecubu,"Sometimes an individual performs acts of horror so unspeakable that the earth they walk on becomes imprinted by their evil. With such villains, even slaying them and scattering their bones can't rid the world of their vile presence. Their souls rise again as guecubus, gruesome skeletons made of scorched bones, rotting flesh, and befouled earth. Guecubus roams the land seeking those they deem responsible for their death. A guecubu remembers what was done to them, and the memories of their supposed mistreatment fuel their quest for revenge. Guecubus are well-equipped to exact such vengeance. Along with monstrous power and the ability to move through earth, they retain all the cunning they had in life. These creatures are known to kill their enemies one by one, leaving no trace of their presence behind save pebbles and dust.",,8
Gug,"A gug’s most horrid feature is its barrel-shaped head, which splits vertically to reveal numerous rows of sharp, yellow teeth and an open throat. Its eyes on either side of its head-jaw are small but keen. Bony ridges protect its eyes from the frantic flailing of its prey, as it prefers meals of raw and writhing meat over fungi and molds. It grips said prey with powerful arms that split at the elbow into a pair of forearms, giving it four clawed paws. These monstrous brutes are covered with shaggy black fur, often crusted with blood and gore. Although gugs may seem bestial, they have keen and wicked intellects. Gugs lair far underground, but they sometimes come to the surface to hunt during dark nights, either alone or in small groups. As they possess voracious appetites, most gugs consume the creatures they catch, but some instead kidnap their victims and retreat below the surface, leaving only a lingering stench and odd, clawed paw-prints. Victims are taken to rancid lairs marked with strange runes and sacrificed to the gugs’ wicked gods of blood, darkness, and nightmares. Dire rumors tell of lightless gug cities made of titanic blocks of stone far underground, where powerful gug leaders preach their vile doctrines to mobs of howling gugs. Gugs have a strange relationship with ghouls, which seems to date from their shared origin in a distant subterranean world. Gugs live in fear of ghouls, despite towering over them; however, this strange fear doesn’t apply to ghasts, whom gugs consume as voraciously as they do other creatures. Gugs stand 16 feet tall and weigh 2,000 pounds, although they have an eerie, graceful gait that belies their immense size. Their light step and ability to squeeze through very small crannies makes gugs common bogeymen in tales of strange disappearances or bloody massacres. Some particularly bloodthirsty gugs gain awful powers as gifts from their eldritch patrons. These monsters are known as savants, are never less than 12th level in power, and gain several occult innate spells. Though each savant’s precise mix of spells varies, normally, these spells grant invisibility, offer power to manipulate and change rock, or invoke awful and destructive energies upon living flesh.",,10

Guildmaster,"In cities, artisans working in a common trade often form guilds to set standards of quality, establish common prices, engage in collective bargaining with business owners, and lobby local governments for favorable laws. The guildmaster—often a master artisan in their own right—also acts as an administrator and politician, advocating for artisans in their trade. The guildmaster is a 12th-level challenge when competing in crafting or their area of expertise (architecture in the example below).",Tradespeople,8
Guloval,"Agathions are born from petitioners who achieved enlightenment in life or after death and received Nirvana's blessing. A guloval is small in stature but fierce, appearing as an anthropomorphic wolverine with gray and black fur, a white strip down the snout, and fearsome digging claws that can be easily used as weapons. A guloval's core value is aggressive protection, and as such, they are one of the most militant of the normally peaceful agathions. A guloval attacks with a frightening ferocity to protect others, and they particularly seek out roles as guardians of children or the elderly. Despite this compulsion to protect those who may not be able to defend themselves, gulovals are also known for grumpy temperaments and impatience with social niceties. Most prefer to live as hermits when they're not assisting someone in need.",Agathion,12
Gumiho,"Gumihos are legendary nine-tailed fox creatures who, when disguised in humanoid form, use charm and guile to lure prey deep into the forest before revealing their true form and striking. The green-eyed canids use brutally sharp fangs to tear out their victim's throat and feast on their liver. Those few who survive a gumiho's trap recall the canid's eerie green eyes as well as a strange marble amulet warn around the monster's neck. Old stories claim that a fox transforms into a gumiho once it has lived for a thousand years, quadrupling in size, growing eight additional tails, and gaining the power to change shape. Terrifyingly, it also gains an insatiable hunger for the livers of people. This hunger is so closely connected to a gumiho's power that if it abstains from eating liver for one thousand days, the gumiho loses its magic and permanently takes on its humanoid guise—also losing its evil nature in the process.",,17
Gurgist Mauler,"Humans that become mortics are known as gurgists. They retain their personalities and intelligence, but their bodies rot with every beat of their heart. Gurgists ceaselessly crave raw meat; consuming large quantities can slow, or even reverse, their body's putrefaction for a short time. A gurgist that refuses to consume raw meat rots to death. Unlike other mortics, gurgists are capable of sating their hunger without resorting to depravity, making them more likely to be nonevil compared to other mortics. Most gurgists hunt and raise livestock for food—including animals many consider too dangerous to tame. To battle their constant hunger, many take up a single craft, hobby, or performing art to obsess over until the drive to create overcomes the urge to consume. Many study magic or medicine, researching methods to reverse their condition or suspend their putrescence. Others cling to religion, uttering prayers despite the pain and begging the gods to cleanse them of evil. Nearly all gurgists are disgusted by their clumsy, rotting bodies. They shroud themselves in fine clothes and cover their faces with elaborate masks. Most consider their mask their true face.",Mortic,6
Guthallath,"A guthallath is an enormous construct created long ago by some unknown empire, probably as a war machine. Nearly 100 feet tall, this massive stone statue typically resembles a stalwart warrior wearing only a loincloth and skullcap. Few have seen the entire body of a guthallath, though; most of the time such a relic is buried up to its neck, covered in moss and stranded in some forgotten place. Yet, every so often, one of these harbingers of destruction reactivates in response to some unknown stimulus or rallying call, and when this happens, woe be unto any who stand in its way. While the guthallath’s ancient enemies are gone, it is an engine of pure destruction, designed to rampage for weeks or even months. While not intelligent enough to enjoy or regret its acts, the guthallath cannot be reasoned with—it is unaffected by most magic, and is unpredictable in how it selects its targets (and creatures it spares).",,19
Gylou,"Though gylous are deeply entrenched in the expansive and complex machinations of Hell, they are highly skilled agents capable of nuanced diplomacy, masterful deception, physical finesse, and nearly any other tasks they set their minds to. This versatility has led to gylous becoming widespread throughout all layers of Hell, enabling them to filter key information to their masters regarding other devils' plots and schemes. Their allegiance is no secret, but their skills are so great that powerful devils employ one or more gylous regardless. While most gylous have a feminine form (combined with their role, this is the source of their common moniker of “handmaiden”), some have other gender presentations, and nearly all gylous take on carefully cultivated illusions to best suit the roles they fill. More often than not, gylous arise when lesser devils who have demonstrated exceptional utility and invaluable skills are uplifted into a new form, though on rare occasions they are shaped from the souls of evil mortals who showed unparalleled savvy within bureaucratic enterprises.",Devil,14
Hadi Mob,"Daemons, including leukodaemons, once ruled over part of the fallen city of Kho. While they did, they created the first hadis. Hadis look more fiendish and sinister than typical ratfolk. In hadi society, those who foster and cultivate blights and sickness are alchemists known as “tafens”. Others, known as “rajwans,” focus their training on brutal combat and barbarian rages. Individually, most hadis are no match for a high level group, but when confronted in their lair, they can gather together into a dangerous mob.",,15
Hadrinnex,"The bizarre hadrinnexes resemble defensive systems more than living creatures. They evolve at a rapid rate, but only to specific attacks against them, which suggests they were created through advanced technology or magic. The husk surrounding a hadrinnex—flecks of metal suspended in a malleable organic carapace—reshapes in response to harm. So too can a glowing gland within the creature's thorax, which collects energy and restructures the creature's biology to protect it from that energy. This organ is fragile and ruptures soon after a hadrinnex is killed. Hadrinnexes have only a rudimentary intellect and usually follow more intelligent aberrations. As bodyguards or peons, they perform simple tasks diligently. Though poor at problem-solving and improvisation, hadrinnexes' dependability and adaptive physiology make them ideal for dangerous tasks in hazardous environments.",,8
Hadrosaurid,"Hadrosaurids are a broad grouping of herbivorous dinosaurs that share characteristic flat snouts filled with rows of grinding teeth well suited for feeding on vegetation. Also known as “duck-billed dinosaurs” due to the unusual shape of their jaws, hadrosaurids are lumbering creatures that can rival an elephant for size, although they tend to be much less aggressive and are prone to flight when confronted with danger rather than stubbornly standing their ground. Many species of hadrosaurids have uniquely shaped crests on their heads that give each species its own unusual profile, making them easily recognizable even to an amateur dinosaur watcher.Giants and other oversized creatures have been known to domesticate hadrosaurids to serve as livestock. Despite their ability to sprint quickly, they don't make particularly viable mounts due to their timid natures, but in a large group, a panicked gathering of hadrosaurids can wreak great damage with their trampling.A hadrosaurid can walk for short distances on its hind legs but prefers to graze and travel on all fours. The typical hadrosaurid is 20 to 30 feet long and can weigh up to 10,000 pounds.",Dinosaur,4
Hamatula,"Hamatulas are forged in Erebus to protect infernal vaults from those foolish enough to try to rob the archdevil Mammon. In case the vicious spines protruding from their bodies and ability to teleport weren't deadly enough, they are also clever wielders of warding glyphs. They are effective conjured guardians, though they resent being pulled away from their duties in Hell. Unlike most fiends, hamatulas are formed from several souls that lack any features distinctive enough to merit another role.",Devil,11
Haniver,"Hanivers are the most benign type of gremlin—capricious fey who skim the waves on rubbery fin-wings. Though they don't actively sabotage their environment, sailors bemoan these gremlins' grasping fingers. Hanivers' incessant curiosity compels them to examine any object that draws their attention. Such treasures might include an overturned fruit basket, a sack of coins, or a shark's gleaming teeth (often still in the shark's mouth, to the fey's regret). Should hanivers like what they find, they steal it, making them a bane to fishers and dockworkers everywhere.",Gremlin,-1
Hantu Belian,"The hantu belian represents the spiritual essence of a tiger and typically manifests as a ghostly bird perched on a tiger's back. Hantu belians commit acts of great destruction as well as restoration. They sometimes possess humanoids to cause great discord and devastation, though their intentions are typically borne of amusement or boredom rather than malice.",Hantu,11
Hantu Denai,"When an environment such as a forest or stream is at risk of overhunting or overfishing, the land itself can manifest as a hantu denai in order to defend itself from overconsumption. Hantu denais stalk hunters and emit haunting cries of native fauna to scare off poachers, loggers, and other despoilers of nature before resorting to violence if necessary.",Hantu,9
Harbormaster,"There are three flows important to any port: the seaward and coastal flows, marked by the rise and fall of the tides, and the flow of trade. A harbormaster is expected to know the former two reflexively and encourage the latter while knowing jurisdictional rules of law. Often old hands of the sea, harbormasters find themselves anchored to a port by commitment, conflict, or reputation.",Magistrates,3
Harmona,"Catching a glimpse of a harmona is said to be lucky. Flying quickly, observing and scouting new areas, these brightly colored avian fey are all but hidden to the eye. A soft buzz accompanies them, discernible only to creatures with particularly keen hearing. Intelligent and curious, these tiny fey birds freely roam the First World, accompanying high-ranking fey creatures such as queens or their courts. In turn, companions who treat a harmona with respect for their knowledge and skill benefit from the harmona's aid in times of need. When these curious creatures find a natural gate between the planes, they glide through to explore and expand their knowledge. Those who find their way onto the Material Plane often choose to remain there in search of diverse and unusual places. This frequently leads them to the same locations that draw in curious adventurers. A harmona might befriend a non-fey adventurer as a companion, but they resent those who would treat them as pets and fight to the death to avoid capture.",,11
Harpy,"Harpies are filthy amalgamations of human and bird, resembling feral humans with wings, talons, and mouths full of sharp teeth. They use captivating songs to lure creatures in, then murder them while they stand transfixed. They enjoy causing confusion and fear in their prey before they strike, believing it creates a savory flavor in the flesh. Harpies can eat most creatures but strongly prefer sapient prey—humans and elves are their favorite. Although harpies will eat goblins if sufficiently hungry, they dislike their flavor and avoid eating them if possible. This doesn’t comfort goblins, of course, who have a particularly strong fear of harpies. Because their aeries often reek with the gore of their kills and careless spatters of guano, harpies carry a distinctly vile scent that canny travelers associate with danger. Harpies who roost close to civilization make better efforts to keep clean, though these efforts have mixed results. Harpies live in family groups or larger clans. They are lightweight despite their size, standing 5 feet tall and weighing only around 90 pounds. While most use relatively simple weapons, some harpies take pride in learning and mastering the use of more complex tools of war such as swords and slings. Those who master the use of the bow, in particular, are often regarded as heroes among their kind and terrors among their victims.",,5

Harrow Doll,"Harrow dolls are unique constructs that can make predictions about the future. The more elite circuses and traveling shows frequently feature a harrow doll, and many use the doll’s abilities to learn more about locals to better customize shows to their tastes—or to find easy marks for later cons. Upset patrons that try to harm a harrow doll or reclaim their payment quickly learn that the construct is more than capable of defending itself.",,8
Harrow Reader,"A harrow deck is a set of 54 cards with symbolic illustrations that serves as a sacred divining tool. Feared by the superstitious and avoided by those who know better than to tempt fate, harrow readers live and work in traveling communities, often moving from town to town as opportunities arise. For encounters involving social interaction, the harrow reader is a 3rd-level challenge.",Mystics,-1
Harvest Regiment,"Great fruiting trees grow in massive orderly rows in a region of the Plane of Wood called Armory Grove. Over the course of decades, a regiment tree's branches grow heavy, laden with fruits uncannily shaped like people. They're cultivated by retired warriors whose tireless work ensures that these fruits grow into a form suitable for battle. Their efforts instill tactical knowledge in these fruit warriors so they're prepared to fight as soon as they fall from the tree—which they do simultaneously, forming one battle-ready unit. Each soldier is equal in skill and similar in form, with a wooden outer shell that splits into portions as the flesh of the fruit inside ripens. A slain warrior contains seeds within its body that can slowly germinate in rich soil with enough water—or blood. Every battlefield can become a new garden.",,8
Hatred Siktempora,"Spawned by acts and legacies of cold-blooded spite, hatred siktemporas kill indiscriminately out of pure loathing, methodically hunting down and slaughtering anyone who catches their vile attention. Fortunately for mortals, they typically limit their predations to the Dimension of Time, where they hunt down creatures foreign to that realm—and some native to it. Hatred siktemporas appear roughly humanoid, but their gaunt forms resemble bone and tendon more than flesh and skin. Adding to their unnerving appearance, their legs have an additional segment between their shin and thigh, and likewise for their eerily long arms. Their featureless faces bear only a singular scar, which takes a different form on every hatred siktempora. They clad themselves in immaculate finery chosen from the most vitriolic empires that ever existed, in the past and the future, and they form a magical garrote as a manifestation of their cold malice.",Siktempora,18
Hegessik,"Anchorites of the proteans, hegessiks live solitary lives roaming the dangerous wilds of the Maelstrom. There, they contemplate cosmic truths and dispense wisdom as itinerant mystics. Hegessiks proudly bear their ridges of golden feathers and gleaming gemstones, but it is within their third eye that their wisdom resides. Hegessiks normally have little interaction with the fluctuations of protean society and are more likely to be found liaising with non-protean monitors and followers of those deities—like Nethys and Besmara— who share the Maelstrom with proteans.",Protean,15
Hekatonkheires Titan,"The first three hekatonkheires were meant to guard the gates to the Abyss, but they proved too terrifying and rebellious— and so, in disgust, the gods cast them into the gulfs between the planes. Hekatonkheires titans are incomplete, monstrous progeny of the original three, from whom these titans calved like icebergs. Hekatonkheires wield interstellar darkness as a weapon and spurn the limits of physical reality, literally reaching through space with their countless arms. Filled with a drive to either discover their lost identity or create their own, they metaphysically disembowel ancient beings and cosmic magics—using the entrails to find clues regarding their own nature and parentage or to serve as raw materials for fueling some alien apotheosis.",Titan,24
Hell Hound,"A hell hound’s appearance dismisses any doubts as to its infernal origins—flesh the color of burning pitch, teeth as sharp as any fiend's pitchfork, and a shroud of ever-burning hell are are all trademark features.",Hell Hound,3
Hellbound Attorney,The Hellbound attorney sought the assistance of a phistophilus—one of Hell's contract devils—to bolster her legalistic ability on the Material Plane.,Devil,4
Hellcat,"Hellcats are devious predators native to the fiery pits of Hell. While the fiendish creatures appears as skeletal smilodons, their bones smoking with heat and dripping with boiling blood, they are not undead. They are living hellspawn with transparent flesh that reveals their burning skeletons. A typical hellcat is 9 feet long and weighs 1,000 pounds. Left to their own devices, hellcats spend their time hunting—that is, seeking and stalking prey just for the thrill of the chase. As fiendish creatures, they do not require mortal sustenance, but they do devour their prey for the sheer pleasure of inflicting pain. They are also far more intelligent than most assume, and they resent being treated as unintelligent animals; those who treat a hellcat as a one may find themself made into a trophy for its pack, as a hellcat goes to great lengths to coordinate elaborate revenge upon those who fail to show proper respect. Though they can't speak, hellcats know Infernal and can communicate by telepathy with any creature capable of speech. They rarely say much except to make whispered threats and to acknowledge the orders of their diabolic masters. Hellcats are quick to retreat if they are clearly outmatched or up against foes they're unable to reach, but they never forget prey that escapes them. They often track potential victims and recruit allies, including other hellcats, to make coordinated attacks or ambushes against their foes.",,7
Hellcrown,"The life of a Hellknight is bloody, brutal, and often short. Many who perish in service to a Hellknight order are glad to rest after having served their masters so faithfully, but others seek to continue their work even in death. When a Hellknight is decapitated, the ghostly undead known as a hellcrown is an occasional result. Consumed by the desire to bring about order by inflicting cruelty, hellcrowns haunt battlefields and abandoned castles, slaying all they encounter. A strange fusion of spirit and steel, a hellcrown has no corporeal form by itself, but instead inhabits the helmet it so proudly wore in life. Dangling from the helmet like a shroud is a shadow of the former Hellknight’s spine, adding to the creature’s terrifyingly gruesome appearance. Hellknights regard hellcrowns with a mixture of disgust and respect, considering the individuals who transform into these floating undead to have been resolute in purpose but weak in body. A hellcrown usually manifests hours or longer after its body’s death, and only when its body is unattended; this might even take days if the Hellknight perished in a major battle. Typically, no recognizable fragment of the Hellknight’s former personality survives the grisly transformation into a hellcrown, but in rare and particularly tragic cases a hellcrown might remember its life and hold grudges against those it views as the cause of its death. Regardless of whether they retain memories of their lives or have lost all former sense of self, hellcrowns linger around the site of their death, reminding all they encounter of the merciless principles of their order.",,1
Hellknight Cavalry Brigade,"A cavalry brigade consists of several Hellknights and a single field-maralictor, in the distinctive armor of their order and bearing lances; the maralictor speaks for the brigade, questioning travelers the brigade encounters and barking orders. A Hellknight brigade is typically based at a keep or other fortification controlling an area measured by a day's ride in every direction—about 25 miles. Farther-ranging missions are possible but require substantial logistical support.",,8
Hellwasp Swarm,"Hellwasps' infernal nature allows them to collectively inhabit and control humanoid corpses, and they use this ability to infest and horrify large swathes of territory unless destroyed. While individual hellwasp poses little threat, these fist-sized insects instinctively form into aggressive swarms that will viciously attack any creature approaching their colony, the lone exception being powerful fiends. Hellwasp swarms have a rudimentary intelligence focused on the protection and expansion of their colony. They can understand Infernal but are incapable of speech. They sometimes obey simple commands from a lawful fiend more powerful than their swarm, but there is no nuance or understanding to this obedience, and if left alone for more than a day they stop obeying and return to their colony.",,8
Herecite of Zevgavizeb,"Secreted away in the dark corners of unnamed libraries, necromancer’s dens, and heretical scriptoriums, obscure texts describe a horrifying ritual that combines sacrifice and suffering to create a powerful undead being known as a herecite. These monsters, stripped of personal will or desire, are born into the service of an evil god whom they worship unerringly and untiringly, often in spite of any opposing religious leanings they may have had in life. Every herecite harbors an unquenchable self-hatred because it was defiled by such a foul resurrection—a rage it turns outward in an attempt to rob others of their faith and lives. Herecites often outlast the cults that create them. Stranded herecites are drawn to others of their kind, even if they are dedicated to different evil deities, and when brought together they perform rites to magically bind themselves in a group known as a cabal. While cabal members share enhanced magic and defenses, induction into a cabal appears to hold even deeper significance for herecites. The presence of others of their kind with whom they can pray—in verses warped to venerate wicked gods—seems the only solace these tormented beings can find in undeath. Such a fellowship of sorrow is nigh unbreakable, as many an overzealous crusader has discovered far too late. Customarily found within heavily modified temples to the pantheon of gods they collectively worship, herecites act in service to their creators or as protectors of unholy ground. High priests of different evil gods may even trade herecites among themselves, allowing their minions to form cabals strengthened by their varied faiths. A lone herecite cut off from its creators—often because it is the sole remnant of a destroyed temple or its master has perished—may wander far and wide in search of a cabal to join. Other times, the herecite seeks out a place sacred to the deity it worshipped in life. Whether motivated by a desire for contrition or vengeance, the end result of this baleful pilgrimage is always the desecration of the holy site and the slaughter of its congregants, who may in turn rise as lesser forms of undead.",Herecite,10
Herexen,"When a cleric rebels against their deity and dies in the grip of blasphemous rage, the heresies they committed in life may fuel their transformation into an undead herexen. Herexens seek vengeance against the deity they once worshipped, defiling temples, slaying the faithful, and rallying lesser undead and death cultists to aid them in their unholy quests. Though a herexen's divine gifts have mostly been corrupted into the vileness of undeath, they stubbornly cling to remnants of their former power, still wielding magic and armaments favored by the deity they so greatly despise. Groups of herexens that blasphemed against the same deity sometimes combine to form a mockery of a congregation, conducting blasphemous rites with something approaching euphoria. These congregations are more often formed from a blasphemous cult who practiced their heresy together in life and died together, though some gather independent herexens of the same former faith.",Herexen,2
Hermit Crab Swarm,"When hermit crabs find a shell that is too large, they lie in wait for others to arrive and move into the shell, abandoning a possible replacement. This can form a large chain of queuing crabs waiting to upgrade their shells. Interruptions can aggravate the crabs, resulting in attacks against the unfortunate source of disruption.",Crab,4
Hesperid,"Hesperides are nymphs of sunset, guardians of the colorful golden hues of the setting sun. They live on remote islands, isolated coastal cliffsides, and hidden valleys, all places where the sunset's golden glow can have the strongest effect. Hesperides manipulate sunlight with dancelike motions, allowing them to create graceful ribbons of light at close range and searing rays at a distance. Due to their connection to the beauty of the daily cycle of the setting sun, hesperides feel a satisfaction from methodical routine that can feel alien to wilder, more chaotic fey. ",Nymph,9
Hesperid Queen,"Hesperid queens rule over isolated regions soaked in the light of sunset. They guard countless treasures and secrets, though for those who approach them with  respect and offer an intriguing bargain, they're willing to part with knowledge or items beyond those secrets or valuables they've sworn to keep to themselves. Hesperid queens are relatively likely to have powerful objects under their protection, such as ancient relics or artifacts. As such, they're keenly aware of the danger posed by unscrupulous treasure hunters seeking to obtain these items at any cost, and they use their incredible minds to set up devious countermeasures to protect their wards, even in the event of their own deaths.",Nymph,19
Hezrou,"Hezrous dwell in the vast and endless Abyssal swamps, mires, and waterways and are equally at home on land and in the water. A hezrou's presence has an obvious effect on nearby flora and water, causing plant life to twist and knot and infusing water with a foul odor and brackish taste—signs much easier to spot on the Material Plane than in the Abyss. Long exposure to this corruption can cause vile transformations and hideous mutations, and entire miserable communities of corrupted creatures sometimes rise in swamplands where a hezrou dwells. Hezrous themselves prefer simple pleasures, and they often waste their considerable intellect in the pursuit of comfortable places to slumber, squealing meals to eat, or objects of beauty to deface. They do not seek out cults to fawn over them but will not turn away those who seek to worship on their own. Hezrous form from the souls of those who abused and polluted their environs or neighbors, either through the introduction of toxins to the region or the insidious spread of drugs and poisons through a society.

Hieracosphinx,"Lacking the intelligence of their kin, falcon-headed hieracosphinxes are cowardly, cruel-hearted creatures. They guard their territory ruthlessly against weaker intruders.",Sphinx,5
Hill Giant,"Selfish and crude, these rough-skinned raiders are bullies and ultimately cowards. Quick-tempered and fond of violence, a hill giant gladly raids and pillages the defenseless but is quick to flee from those who are bigger, stronger, or better organized than they are. A hill giant is never above shoving or tricking one of their own kind to slow down their opponent or get the best loot.",Giant,7
Hippocampus,Hippocampi serve as steeds for aquatic humanoids or roam wild in the sea.,Hippocampus,1
Hippogriff,"With the proud bearing of a great raptor and the magnificence of a powerful horse, hippogriffs are thought to be an accidental fusion of creatures or perhaps the creation of a flesh-warping wizard with a keen aesthetic sense. Regardless of their original source, these animals are now a common sight in the skies above their favored plains or hill country. Hippogriffs bear the wings, forelegs, and head of a bird of prey, with feather coloration similar to that of a hawk or eagle, though some breeders have managed to produce specimens with stark-white or coal-black feathers. Their torso, hindquarters, and tail resemble those of a horse and usually are colored bay, chestnut, or gray, with some coats bearing black, pinto, or even palomino coloration. Hippogriffs are similar in size to large horses. Much like their equine cousins, hippogriffs often have to keep wary eyes on the skies above them, as both are preferred meals for hungry griffons and wyverns. Only hippogriffs' superior speed helps protect them from these predators. Hippogriffs are exceptionally territorial and fiercely protect the lands under their domain. They typically favor sweeping grasslands, rolling hills, and prairies. Exceptionally hardy hippogriffs make their homes nestled into niches on canyon walls, from which they comb the rocky deserts for coyotes, deer, and the occasional humanoid. Hippogriffs prefer mammalian prey, but they graze after every meal to aid in digestion. Since hippogriff hunting habits can be dangerous to both ranchers and their livestock, such communities often set bounties on hippogriffs. As a result, preserved hippogriffs frequently decorate frontier taverns and remote outposts alongside the taxidermic remains of deer, elk, and bears. However, other communities train hippogriffs from hatching to be ridden by elite soldiers in combat— the most notable among these groups in the Inner Sea region is the Sable Company Mercenaries in the city-state of Korvosa. Attempts are sometimes made to train adult hippogriffs in the same manner, but this often proves far more difficult. Hippogriff riders must use special saddles and combat techniques that allow them to act in concert with their mount, fighting effectively while avoiding interfering with the movement of their companion's wings.",,2
Hippopotamus,"Typical adult hippos move quickly on land and attack stealthily in the water. Though herbivorous, hippos are notoriously aggressive and territorial.",Hippopotamus,5
Hive Mother,"Ankhrav hive mothers are fearsome predators that one can easily distinguish from the typical ankhrav not only by their greater size, but the presence of a large pair of razor-sharp, mantis-like arms.",Ankhrav,8
Hobgoblin Archer,"Bands of hobgoblin soldiers typically have at least one archer among their ranks. In smaller groups, the hobgoblin archer also serves as that band’s captain.",Hobgoblin,4
Hobgoblin General,Hobgoblin generals serve as leaders of entire armies and rulers of hobgoblin settlements. A general does not permit the luxuries of rule to soften them. They lead their forces on the field of battle and view this opportunity to excel in a fight at the head of an army as the true reward for a life spent honing one’s skills in battle.,Hobgoblin,6
Hobgoblin Soldier,"Soldiers make up the bulk of hobgoblin society, whether that society is a village or a military unit.",Hobgoblin,1
Hodag,"Because they are often described only in drunken retellings of loggers' or miners' tales, hodags are considered by many to exist only in the local folklore of remote areas. However, some individuals have actually encountered these dangerous beasts firsthand, and even fewer have lived to tell their tales. Hodags are reptilian creatures the size of bulls. These vicious predators' long claws can tear creatures apart in seconds. Their backs sport dozens of long spines that run from their snouts all the way down the length of their powerful tails. Their wide mouths are full of sharp and twisted rows of teeth not unlike those of a shark. The hodags' rough, scaly hides carry hues of green and brown, allowing them to blend into their forest surroundings where they ambush prey. Only their glowing red eyes reveal their presence, though hodags have learned to use this to their advantage by drawing attention to their eyes in one area, then closing their eyes and stealthily moving to another area to cause their prey to misconstrue their location. In the wintertime, when snow and ice blankets a region, hodags grow a foul-smelling coat of greasy, dark-brown fur that sprouts in tufts from between their scales. A typical hodag measures over 10 feet long from snout to tail and weighs upward of 700 pounds.",,6
Hollow Serpent,"A hollow serpent is the dried and shriveled husk of an enormous constrictor snake, animated by fell magic to serve its masters. According to the oldest holy books of serpentfolk, the first hollow serpents were raised by Ydersius. The god took the cast-off skins of great snakes and filled them with hunger and hatred, a bottomless yearning for mortal life that could never be filled. In due course, the priests of the serpentfolk learned to replicate their lord's trick, and in the millennia since the serpentfolk's fall, the knowledge has slithered into the libraries of other necromancers and sorcerers. Despite their menacing reputation and great power, hollow serpents are a relatively uncomplicated creation. They were designed first and foremost as guardians, and serpentfolk liches of a suitable level of power are sometimes accompanied by hollow serpents. A few have struck out on their own over the years, usually due to outliving their original creators. Driven by their hunger and dim intellect, they take up residence in remote ruins or deep caverns. Those that study such things believe at least one serpent, perhaps one of the original creatures made by Ydersius, survives in the mountains west of Geb.",,15
Homunculus,"A homunculus is a tiny servitor construct created by a crafter to serve as a spy, scout, messenger, or assistant. When a crafter first begins to study the art of creating constructs, she often crafts a homunculus first, since the creation process is simple and inexpensive due to a magical shortcut: the use of the creator’s own blood. This forges a link between the homunculus and its master, causing the homunculus to gain a spark of the creator’s intellect, as well as the same moral values and some of the creator’s basic personality traits. Homunculi left to their own devices never stray far from their masters. In most cases, a homunculus doesn’t survive the death of its master for long. Deprived of its creator, a homunculus loses focus and grows increasingly self-destructive, and some even end up battering themselves to destruction. Rarely, a homunculus with a slain master survives the trauma with its mind intact, often seeing itself as its deceased creator’s child or successor and attempting to further its creator’s legacy as best it can. In such cases, and if the homunculus was in close proximity to its master upon that creature’s death, a portion of the dead master’s soul “infects” the surviving homunculus as it passes on to the afterlife. This doesn’t result in a truly soulbound homunculus (see sidebar), since only a fragment of the soul is left behind, but this is still enough to grant the homunculus a greater personality, free will of its own, and perhaps most importantly, the ability to speak. Over time, a few of these “awakened” homunculi even go so far as to become convinced that they are the reincarnation of their prior masters, although their actual personalities never quite reach the depth and complexity of a truly living creature. They are, at best, caricatures of the master, and at worst they become awful, bitter-minded parodies of life itself. Still, a free-willed homunculus might pursue studies in its creator’s class, becoming a unique creature with the abilities of that class if time and fortune permit. Homunculi are created from a mixture of clay, ash, mandrake root, spring water, and a pint of the creator’s own blood. It is possible for a separate donor to provide the blood, but the process is more difficult.",,0
Horde Lich,"At first glance, a horde lich looks like a skeleton packed with too many bones. In combat, the true purpose of these extra parts becomes clear as limbs peel off, expanding and reassembling into another nimble skeletal form. Regardless of the number, the single lich mind controls them all, and if any of them survive an encounter, they can rebuild the whole given enough time and raw materials. Creating A Horde Lich A horde lich trades frightful presence, Drain Soul Cage, and paralyzing touch for the servitor abilities listed below and the Shatter Block reaction.",Lich,15
Horned Archon,"Horned archons are secretive and tireless sentinels and scouts, patrolling the Outer Sphere’s untamed wilds for evil to eliminate and keeping small communities safe from demons, devils, and worse. They resemble muscular humans with the head, horns, and legs of a stag. When requested to do so by their patrons, especially Erastil, they journey to the Material Plane and patrol dangerous frontier areas, secretly performing acts of kindness such as leading hunters to food, helping lost children, and driving off evil creatures. Because they roam the wilds of Nirvana and Elysium, horned archons are among the best at understanding the perspectives of other celestials.",Archon,4
Hound Archon,"Among the rank-and-file soldiers of Heaven's armies, few individuals are more dependable and truer to the cause than the noble hound archons, embodiments of the virtue of diligence. Unlike horned archons, who perform at a similar level along Heaven's grand hierarchy, hound archons do not scout ahead for evil or perform reconnaissance missions in hostile territory. A hound archon's role is as a soldier in the heart of battle or, occasionally, as a sentinel tasked with protecting a particular strategic location or holy site.",Archon,4
Hound of Tindalos,"Lean and athirst, the hounds of Tindalos are drawn to those who tamper with the flow of time, travel through time, or use magic or rare alchemical drugs to send their thoughts or perception back or forward in time. Powerful spellcasters can draw them from the Dimension of Time via rare rituals, but doing so attracts the hounds' ire, so few who traffic in such rituals live long enough to spread their knowledge. While the hounds possess great cunning and cruel intellect, they rarely interact with other creatures—other than to hunt and destroy those who have attracted their unblinking attention. Once a hound catches scent of a mortal to hunt, it calls others of its ilk. The pack then pursues its victim through all space and time until it catches, slays and devours them. Those pursued can escape only by avoiding all angles, as hounds of Tindalos could step through them from nothingness at any time.",,7
House Drake,"Beautifully colored in purples and electric blues, these tiny dragons are genuinely brilliant in more ways than one. They are playful and kind, and while they have a long tradition of assisting spellcasters, they prefer to be treated as equals and partners rather than pets. They're quite intelligent and don't appreciate condescension from those who treat them as simple animals. Tiny dragons have appeared in tales told among traditional Varisian communities for centuries, but only relatively recently have they become known by the name “house drake.” This new name arose in the city of Korvosa, where house drakes have adapted particularly well to urban life. When students of the magic school called the Acadamae failed in their studies and allowed their imp familiars to run wild, these tiny dragons found that they were particularly well suited to combating them. Most notably, their teeth become striated with silver due to their peculiar grooming habits, allowing their bites to puncture the imps' magically resistant skin. The two species are well-matched in intellect. Though their clashes typically begin with trying to outwit one another, they often end in messy brawls across rooftops and into alleys. The residents of Korvosa appreciated both the protection and the dragons' charming appearance and demeanor. House drakes are now more common in Korvosa than anywhere else in the world. House drakes are carnivorous, eating vermin and small birds. Though they're capable of hunting for food, many of them find it a bit dull and prefer to spend their time at other pursuits. They happily accept donations of food. To truly get on a house drake's good side, though, one should offer a gift of silver. Donations to drakes have become regular practice in Korvosa, to the point where “Paid any drakes lately?” has become a common phrase to suggest someone is a bit gullible and soft-hearted. These donations are just that—charity. House drakes avoid taking on anything resembling a “job,” taking pride in their self-sufficiency and ability to choose for themselves how to spend their time.",,1
Huldra,"At first glance, a huldra seems a simple creature—a human in plain robes or peasant dress, sporting long, unbound hair. These tresses and full skirts in fact disguise the huldra's supernatural features: a hollow wooden back, a long bovine tail, and incredible strength. Folk legends from the lands of the north describe huldras as the creations of troll witches, intended to lure potential meals to the slaughter. Indeed, a huldra's regeneration is so similar to a troll's that a link between the two creatures seems entirely possible, but huldras despise trolls and resent tales suggesting any connection between them. Rather, huldras are wardens of the woodlands they occupy. Grown from saplings by powerful forest-dwelling fey as a response to humanoid encroachment, huldras protect and parley for the forest itself. Woodland creatures adore huldras, and sometimes approach humans or elves thinking they're huldras. This illusion is shattered if the animal sees the humanoid's back is made of flesh or that they're lacking a tail, at which point the animal recoils and runs away. Huldras respond well to travelers who show respect and deference for the forest, bestowing those they favor with supernatural luck and fortune. Those who scorn or attack a huldra, or those who mock their distinctive, bovine tails, find themselves plagued by poor decisions and even worse luck. Huldras commonly carry a bad reputation as sirens of the deep forest—cunning monsters who seek to lure woodcutters and unwary adventurers to uncertain ends. These stories largely come from miscreants foolish enough to have treated a huldra rudely and later complain about how they were unjustly persecuted. Even woodcutters and hunters can stay in the good graces of huldras provided they plant new trees to replace what they've taken and don't kill any creatures they don't eat. Though huldras choose to appear unassuming, the attention they put into disguising the supernatural parts of their bodies is sometimes lacking when it comes to their strength. They often perform feats of strength, like bending horseshoes straight or lifting heavy objects, without realizing they're breaking their carefully crafted facade.",,4
Hungry Ghost,"Hungry ghosts arise from those who didn't receive proper burials or whose graves were neglected. They are not bound to a site or item but are compelled to see opportunities to commit good deeds in hopes of gaining favors that can aid them in achieving a final rest. Their need to feed on living energy often conflicts with this goal, however.",Ghost,6
Hunter,"As is reflected in the many depictions of an elk-headed Erastil, god of the hunt, the hunter is very much a creature of the forest, known by the forest and familiar with every aspect of it. After all, the final determination of who is the hunter and who is prey often depends on who is able to make an ally of the terrain.",Foresters,7
Hunter Wight,"Dangers deep in the wilderness claim the life some lone scout or hunter. When they arise as wights, they renew their hunt with equal vigor, but all the living are now their prey. Hunter wights prefer to seek strategic ground, frequently taking residence atop hills or within abandoned watchtowers and keeps.",Wight,7
Hunting Spider,"Hunting spiders are the most common type of giant spider, though not the largest.",Spider,1
Hurlilu,"Pazuzu's Abyssal realm of High M'Vania is perched on the edge of an impossibly tall cliff. The demon lord and his minions claim the air around the cliff, guarding it against enemies and usurpers alike. Hurlilus, resembling horned, humanoid hawks with blood-red taloned feet and wings in place of arms, patrol these skies at their lord's command. Yet, hurlilus are surly and rebellious by nature, preferring to lead rather than follow orders. They'd prefer to spend their time bullying smaller creatures in High M'Vania's vast cliffside cities, but they're unwelcome there and driven out when discovered by occupants with greater authority (or by those who want to earn greater authority). Hurlilus make good guardians, particularly when they have leave to travel over great distances on patrol routes and can engage in spontaneous cruelty if the opportunity arises. However, they chafe in Pazuzu's service. Some forsake High M'Vania entirely and migrate to other parts of the Abyss, where they lead gangs of lesser fiends they've bullied into submission. A few hurlilus have made their way to Golarion, where they roost in aeries with subservient harpies, manticores, or other foul flying creatures. A dozen or so hurlilus serve high positions in the Mivanians, the brutal enforcers of the Halana Theocracy.",Lilu,11
Husk Zombie,"Rather than allow a body to rot, some necromancers attempt to dry-cure the corpse to prevent further deterioration. Combined with special reagents, this process can preserve a rudimentary form of intelligence, allowing husk zombies to act more like predators than their mindless kin. Most husk zombies have no memories of their prior lives, though some keep trinkets from that time, oblivious as to why they value such items. A rare few husk zombies retain most of their former knowledge, though they tend to have gaps in their memory.",Zombie,2
Hyaenodon,"Hyaenodons are the ferocious primeval cousins of the smaller hyena. Looming, shaggy-furred creatures nearly the size of a horse, hyaenodons are truly formidable predators to be reckoned with, due both to their size and to their bone-crushing jaws. Gnoll clans find these creatures particularly useful as mounts and guardians.",Hyena,3
Hyakume,"Hundreds of bloodshot eyes peek out from under the fleshy layers of a hyakume's skin. These hulking aberrations covet knowledge and go to great lengths to keep what they know to themselves; they'll destroy scriptoriums they've raided and burn books they've read to ensure no other soul learns their contents. While hyakume occasionally trade valuable information to garner greater knowledge, they are liable to trick their targets into revealing more than they should. Most frightening of all is the hyakume's ability to steal memories and erase any knowledge of their existence from the minds of their victims.",,15
Hydra,"Hydras are multiheaded, foul-tempered serpentine beasts with voracious appetites, widely feared for their regeneration abilities.",,6
Hyena,"Hyenas are cunning, powerfully built carnivores that bear a heavy resemblance to dogs and other canines, though they are not themselves canines. Though all hyenas are often maligned as cowardly carrion eaters, their tactics depend on their specific breed: spotted hyenas are active pack hunters that kill most of their prey themselves, while striped and brown hyenas are more likely to be scavengers. Their jaws are exceptionally powerful, allowing hyenas to seize a victim and pull it to the rest of the pack.",Hyena,1
Hyphae Tyrant,"Leshy creations sometimes fall prey to herbivores and foragers. Whereas most take the loss in stride, fungus leshies sometimes grow bitter and explore the grimmer elements of fungi: decomposition and possession. Combining unethical experiments, mind-altering cordyceps spores, and occult magic fueled by their own victim narrative, a fungus leshy can transform into a hyphae tyrant, who in turn transforms corpses into sporeborn puppets to torment local fauna. These leshies' greatest tragedy is perhaps their own impermanence. As their agendas increasingly celebrate decay, a hyphae tyrant's spite and occult narrative slowly drain their life force, ultimately ending in a final burst of destructive energy.",,4
I'iko Dragon,"I'iko dragons are greedy bullies with long muscular bodies, stubby legs, small wings, and shimmering glass-like scales. From their treetop nests overhanging well-traveled rivers, i'iko dragons land on passing watercrafts and extort the passengers, threatening to capsize boats if not paid with bright treasure. When faced with a well-armed group guarding their desired trinkets, they instead resort to stealth, stealing them under cover of darkness, using their claws to pick locks and disable traps as needed. I'iko dragons reside in the jungles of the Mwangi Expanse, particularly in Nantambu where they live under the tall arching bridges that cross the city's many canals, building roosts in the bridge supports. I'iko dragons eat fish and birds, and have a taste for glass, crystals, and gemstones, which they consume to harden and color their scales. Incredibly vain, i'iko dragons collect the most colorful glass they can find to transform their scales into a resplendent rainbow.",,6
Ice Golem,"Ice golems are either carved from massive blocks of ice, or pieced together from individual components that are then fused together through heat and refreezing. In most cases, the resulting shape is little more than a crude approximation of a humanoid form, but given the right talent, an ice golem could be an exquisitely carved statue of a mythical creature, famous persona, or even a deity. While ice golems most frequently serve as guardians in freezing climates, the magic that holds an ice golem together keeps it from melting in warmer temperatures. This, combined with the fact that ice golems lie on the lower end of the scale as far as cost and difficulty to create, gives these constructs unusual features that puts them in great demand. The rich and powerful in hot, arid regions often commission ice golems not only as guardians for their estates and vaults, but for comfort—the presence of an ice golem standing quietly sentinel in the corner of a room can help to keep the chamber at a comfortable temperature. The truly decadent use ice golems as servants to keep drinks cold.",Golem,5
Ice Linnorm,"The ice linnorm dwells amid glacial crevasses, atop wind-blasted mountain peaks, or within glittering caverns carved from the hearts of the mightiest of icebergs.",Linnorm,17
Ice Mephit,"Though capable of the same depths of cruelty as their fire mephit kin, ice mephits carry theirs out in a more calculating way. Unlike most mephits, these pale blue mephits prefer solitude to company. Lacking in empathy, they are known for their callousness, and have a reputation for brutal honesty. They also have few moral qualms about acting selfishly and exploiting weakness for their own gain, should the chance arise.","Elemental, Mephit",1
Ice Mummy,"The cold of high places coupled with strong winds and less oxygen creates an effect that can preserve bodies, mummifying them through natural processes. Many are created deliberately by cults, and a rare few voluntarily transform.",Mummy,8
Ice Yai,"Ice yai combine the brutality of frost giants with the grace of martial artists. More than any other oni, ice yai delight not in the pleasures of the flesh, but in flesh itself—rather than indulging in oft-destructive mortal vices like drink or lust, ice yai pursue physical perfection, reveling in the process of turning their bodies into powerful fighting machines.",Oni,13
Icewyrm,"Resembling wingless, serpentine dragons formed of jagged ice and shot through with veins of nearly frozen water, these elementals dwell within icebergs and enjoy striking out at passing ships or creatures. They're especially common in frigid stretches of ocean in the Plane of Water, where icebergs cluster together into enormous islands of ice.","Elemental, Water",10
Ichor Slinger,"While the typical snake oil salesperson seeks riches, some medical fraudsters become so enamored with the swindler lifestyle they reanimate to keep living the lie. Known as ichor slingers, these cadaverous alchemists disguise themselves to walk among the living. There they gleefully concoct tonics and peddle cure-alls, charismatically convincing bystanders to overlook questionable ingredients and credentials. Ichor slingers feed on others' attention and trust, caring little for clients' health so long as buyers imbibe the offered medicines. Conversely, rejection infuriates ichor slingers. The undead often stalk, subdue, and administer unwanted medicines to those who snub them. When not selling “panaceas,” ichor slingers harvest macabre ingredients to make dubious new medicines.",,4
Icicle Snake,"Translucent and capable of hanging suspended and near motionless, icicle snakes sense the heat of living creatures as a threat and attempt to use their camouflage and chilling bite against foes.","Elemental, Water",2
Ifrit Pyrochemist,"Ifrits' blood blazes with elemental fire. Most ifrits are second-class citizens who serve under the iron heel of the efreeti and their Dominion of Flame, but those born outside the efreet hierarchy or who choose to flee it live lives of passion in search of fame, glory, and power. Ifrits are fond of fire, but this doesn't mean they all embrace fire's destructive nature. Those who seek more productive roles in a society find inspiration in the way flames flit and dance, and they pride themselves in their skills as acrobats or dancers. The church of Sarenrae particularly welcomes ifrit fire dancers, both in appreciation of their skill and to help ensure these ifrits have a safe place apart from their more violent kin. But by and large, ifrits are drawn to professions and callings that allow them to wallow in the glories of fire. Ifrit pyrochemists apply this calling to alchemical teachings, seeing purity in every single bomb thrown or conflagration lit.",Geniekin,1

Iguanodon,"Iguanodons are large, herbivorous dinosaurs that inhabit swamps and forests where they browse on the abundant vegetation. The iguanodon is capable of moving on two feet or on four, quickly switching from one stance to the other depending on whether it needs to move through dense foliage or to reach delectable morsels hanging up in the canopy.Although iguanodons are herbivores, they are notoriously quick to anger. Their thumb spikes make their claws particularly devastating weapons. A well-placed blow from one of these claws can turn a hungry predator into a cowering beast with one swift strike. Iguanodons are 30 feet long and weigh 6,000 pounds.",Dinosaur,6

Imentesh,"The loquacious proteans known as imenteshes serve as missionaries, spies, and heralds of chaos to further the protean goal of reality's dissolution. Imenteshes are cunning, curiously diplomatic, and profoundly whimsical.

Immolis,"Most complex organisms, whether plant or animal, produce energy by converting fuel (such as food) into heat. Though this process is invaluable, it's also a vulnerability—one that the immolis has evolved to exploit. Immolises are psychic predators found all across Castrovel, especially underground and in cool environs. Mostly blind, they hunt by sensing the body heat of other creatures. When an immolis acquires a target, it focuses its innate psychic energies in an invisible beam aimed at its prey. The sudden influx of energy causes the target's metabolism to accelerate rapidly, spurring the creature's body to produce energy at a dangerous rate. This sudden rush of heat literally cooks the creature internally— innards burst, blood boils, and fat catches fire. The end result isn't just warm food, but a meal roasted to morbid perfection. An immolis's basic shape resembles that of a spidery, spindly frog covered in delicate scales. The head has a simian muzzle, the lips of which pull back to reveal a squid-like beak. Above the mouth, the creature has three pairs of nostrils, which fare and chuff as the creature hunts. Though they walk with a hunch, immolises climb with shocking speed. Unlike many other pyro-predators, immolises have a deep and paradoxical fear of fire, perhaps because they know how easily any flesh— their own included—can blacken and burn. As a result, they prefer to lair near water. This presents its own problem, however, as their heat sense is easily disrupted by creatures taking steps to hide their heat signatures, such as submerging themselves in water or snow. While intelligent enough to communicate and band together with others of their kind, immolises view all other species as either prey or threats and have as little interest in cultural exchange as in personal possessions. The average immolis stands 5 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.",,3
Immortal Ichor,"An immortal ichor is an intelligent mass of blood from a dead evil deity. The cultists who perform the ritual to create immortal ichor typically seal up the sentient ooze in an underground or remote chamber that blocks its magical abilities, but over time these seals break or weaken, freeing the unholy monster.",,15
Imp,"Imps are infiltrators and corruptors who, despite their diminutive stature, are more than capable of subtly influencing a weak-willed individual into performing increasingly evil acts over time. An imp will often agree to serve a mortal and act docile and loyal in a long-term plot to eventually damn its master’s soul to Hell. Imps are born directly from Hell itself, rather than from mortal souls, and thus they serve outside the usual diabolic hierarchy, granting them leeway to pursue their specialties. Despite standing a mere 2-feet tall, imps can be vicious combatants, flying out of reach and turning invisible to escape should the odds turn against them.",Devil,1
Incutilis,"Incutilises are intelligent, nautilus-like sea creatures that attack their victims' brains to take over their bodies, creating puppets to use for labor, combat, or their own malevolent amusement. An adult incutilis is slightly smaller than an adult human head. Its shell bears a pattern of crimson streaks that resemble the ridges and furrows of a brain. Incutilises hatch within the depths of the sea, where they start off consuming bottom-dwelling crustaceans and sometimes even whales or sharks, but as they grow into adults, incutilises instinctively crave the complex tissues of other creatures' brains—the more complex, the better. An incutilis makes excursions onto land specifically to use their iconic puppetmaster ability. They use their tentacles to crawl up onto shore or climb aboard a ship. An incutilis then drives their tendrils directly into the brain of a helpless living (or very recently dead) land creature, taking control of it through this neurological connection. They prefer to target humanoids and animals. This host—now called a puppet—rarely survives the experience. After the incutilis has taken full control, they can usually ride their puppet for as long as they wish. Often, they use the puppet to seek out other potential prey, battling other creatures until the wear and tear from repeated conflict renders the body useless.",,2
Inmyeonjo,"Mountain guides whisper stories of giant white birds that stretch towards the sky, singing with human voices. While these stories are often dismissed as tall tales, the truth is much stranger, for the bird they've encountered not only has a human voice, but one a human face as well. Inmyeonjos are enormous white birds with flowing tails, abnormally long necks, and mask-like human faces. They wear an elongated black headpiece that serves as a vessel for their life energy, enabling their reincarnation through any living creature. Inmyeonjos often serve as gatekeepers or guardians of the tombs of great sages and leaders who brought peace to their lands and people. They can also be found atop on high mountains where the border between earth and sky is thinnest. Ultimately, inmyeonjos strive for balance and peace among all mortals. A person who has encountered an inmyeonjo often has trouble remembering if the strange creature was beautiful or terrifying.",,16
Innkeeper,"The sight of an inn is a welcome one to any weary traveler. Innkeepers can often be found cleaning the common room, overseeing the evening meal, or settling in new lodgers. Innkeepers keep an eye on their neighbors' doings and are often excellent sources of information.",Publicans,1
Intellect Assemblage,"Intellect assemblages are artificial constructs created from the memories of others. These memories are solidified into jagged shards similar in appearance to shattered glass and fused together in vaguely humanoid-shaped clusters to create the assemblage's body. The resulting construct is incredibly intelligent but completely devoid of emotion, possessing the thoughts and memories of a multitude but no personal connection to any of them. Analytical and meticulous, intellect assemblages view the world and everything in it as parts of a complex equation or system. They place no value on life or morality and consider emotions an illogical weakness.",,19
Intellect Devourer,"Intellect devourers serve as advance scouts and infiltrators for the powerful force of alien beings called the Dominion of the Black. These monsters roam the Darklands, from which they mount secret invasions of the world above. When an intellect devourer infiltrates a society, its first priority is to acquire a body. It might first seek out a graveyard for a fresh corpse, as this is easier than fighting and killing someone. When the aberration compresses itself into the host's brain cavity, its real body goes dull to sensation as it connects to the nervous system of its host. If found out, an intellect devourer might quickly inhabit a new body to make its escape, preferably something inconspicuous such as a domestic animal.",,8
Interlocutor,"Interlocutors are the most talented surgeon-sculptors of the velstracs, carving away flesh and replacing it with new body parts of muscle, sinew, and metal. Each interlocutor structures their individual appearance carefully, but all are towering, multi-limbed amalgamations of the strongest limbs, densest bone, and sharpest metal they can find. They continually search for new material to graft to their forms, and their slain foes are rarely found intact, as little is more valuable to interlocutors than a powerful opponent's legs, eyes, or even brain. Interlocutors average 9 feet tall and weigh approximately 800 pounds.",Velstrac,12

Ioton,"Periodically, stray thoughts colliding on the Astral Plane become entangled, forming a knot of rudimentary intellect. Known as iotons, these beings lack the willpower to manifest physical bodies, much less the self-awareness and vision to know what form these physical bodies might take. Instead, they manifest as ghostly, cloudlike wisps, each intermittently forming ephemeral features like alien eyes, unspeaking mouths, and shimmering symbols as iotons instinctively process their surroundings. Left alone, they might drift for ages amidst the Silver Sea. Gregariously parasitic, iotons sense and congregate around thinking beings, eagerly tearing off stray thoughts and using the harvested psychic energy to think clearly and form physical bodies. An ioton might understand that this process inflicts painful headaches in its victims, but it typically doesn't care. Not only do most of these ennosites become drunk on their newfound mental power and cling to their captured thoughts, but returning what they stole also robs an ioton of the mental bandwidth necessary to parse right from wrong. This sometimes causes a painful cycle where it repeatedly steals thoughts, apologetically surrenders them, and then blithely steals the thoughts anew. Iotons that gradually accumulate and consolidate enough mental potential form a permanent body, transforming into another type of ennosite.",Ennosite,0
Iridescent Elephant,"An iridescent animal is a wild or domesticated animal that has undergone a magical transformation to become a luminescent beast that can glow in the dark and use dazzling light-based powers. Although the effect is glamorous, the life of an iridescent animal is a sad one. The change drastically weakens the animal, diminishing both its strength and its vitality. This effect is desirable for some—particularly the circuses, menageries, and royal courts that typically purchase these glowing beasts—but never for the animal itself. Because the effects of the transformation are so deleterious, the act of creating an iridescent animal is strongly frowned upon by druids and other naturalists, some of whom dedicate their lives to rescuing and fostering these maltreated creatures. The procedure cannot be reversed, and few iridescent animals are fit to live in the wild after the transformation, cementing their lot in life to serve as showy beasts of burden or objects of entertainment and ridicule.",,7
Irlgaunt,"Irlgaunts resemble titanic spiders or crabs, but with cephalopod-like tendrils erupting from the tips of their chitin-armored legs. Their jagged gray shells allow them to blend into the rocky walls of the high mountain passes and deep ravines that serve as their hunting grounds. Despite their size, they move with incredible alacrity, bounding across chasms and skittering up sheer mountain cliffs without pause. Though they are formidable in melee, irlgaunts have an even more powerful ranged attack. These creatures can pelt their opponents by forcefully regurgitating gastroliths—melon-sized clusters of rocks enveloped in coagulated digestive enzymes strong enough to break down flesh and bone. Gastroliths are fragile and explode on contact, spraying the area with shards of rock and caustic acid. While one might easily mistake an irlgaunt for a simple brutish beast, they have a keen intelligence and use devious hunting strategies. They set traps for travelers and are fond of using gems and magical items taken from previous victims as bait. They have been known to start rockslides or otherwise block passages to reroute explorers into their clutches. They also use their gastroliths to direct the movements of their prey, forcing victims into dead ends at the edge of chasms or cliffs. For the most part, irlgaunts live solitary lives, likely because finding enough food to sustain a community tends to be difficult. However, they still maintain a sense of extended, regional community, actively gathering when organizing for war or to discuss other issues that affect their species or shared territories. They have been known to occasionally ally with giants, but these truces are usually nebulous.",,13
Irnakurse,"Irnakurse are surface elves who drow have subjected to particularly cruel and humiliating fleshwarping practices, as drow take special delight in the torment of their surface-dwelling kin. The process of crafting an irnakurse involves twisting an unfortunate elf into a deformed mass of misplaced limbs, loose flesh, and bony protrusions—parts that should be internal are often left on full display to the world. Irnakurse are subject to mental conditioning that causes them to hate their prior forms, and these creatures prefer to attack surface elves over all other targets.",Fleshwarp,9
Iron Golem,"Traditionally crafted into the forms of giant suits of armor or powerful animals, iron golems are products of exquisite artistry and skill. Their articulated joints and sturdy armored bodies require great care and mathematical precision to craft, and regular cleaning and oiling ensure they don’t rust over the ages. With proper care, iron golems can remain in good shape for thousands of years, being passed down for generations, as long as they aren’t destroyed by meddlesome adventurers. In addition to their incredible strength, iron golems possess a potent toxic breath weapon that is often more than enough to dispatch entire groups of opponents.",Golem,13
Iroran Mummy,"Some enlightened members of the Iroran faith, particularly monks, are so aware of their own bodily processes they can sense their approaching death from old age. Pinpointing the occurrence to the exact hour, a chosen few employ a method of self-mummification. These masters of life and death leave behind their bodies to watch over Irori's temples.",Mummy,10
Iruxi Ossature,"Iruxis, also known as lizardfolk, are surrounded by the spirits of their ancestors—literally, as they honor their dead by incorporating their bones into the architecture of iruxi settlements. Decades of veneration by their descendants have caused primal power to accumulate within these remains. In times of crisis, these earth-encrusted bones reanimate as guardians of last resort. Iruxis often refer to these undead—spirits bathed in starlight animating bone and rock, fueled by the beliefs of the living—as “the twilight guardians.” Iruxi ossatures usually reanimate spontaneously when a nesting chamber is violated or blood is spilled in an iruxi settlement's main hall. Truly ancient settlements might be blessed with a few ossatures' presence at all times: guarding nurseries, reliquaries, and the sacred observatories where their descendants study the heavens. These particularly hardy ossatures are composed of fossilized bone and possess dinosaur-like shield frills, horns, or spiked tails.",,5
Isqulug,"The isqulug's appearance, though unsettling, might be its least awful aspect. The creature resembles a bipedal amphibian with tentacles instead of arms and a head composed of an undulant mass of what appear to be shifting, slimy transparent eggs filled with writhing larvae. In truth, these larvae constitute the mind and consciousness of the isqulug—its “body” is little more than an organic suit manufactured from the flesh of those it has consumed, analogous to the complex web of a spider or the hive of a colony of bees, but fully capable of movement and violence.",,11

Incredibly proud, they're easily offended and quick to anger but lash out only after weighing the consequences. Shuyookhs view their desires as greater than those around them, leading them to provide aid as quickly and efficiently as possible, fulfilling the terms of bargains expediently and to the letter. Jabali shuyookhs are industrious and have many interests, including athletic competitions, engineering, jewelry-making, masonry, metalworking, and sculpting. They enjoy games of chance and bargaining, whether in a gambling hall, arena, or marketplace. Some mix their interests by managing organizations or guilds involving such concerns. Many shuyookhs reap the wealth of the Plane of Earth for sale elsewhere and speculate on the value of such commodities.",Genie,12
Jabberwock,"Few beasts have inspired as many legends, poems, songs, and myths in as many cultures, as this bizarre draconic creature. The jabberwock hails from the fey realm of the First World and is part of a group of powerful First World creatures known collectively as the Tane.Like all members of the Tane, jabberwocks are living creatures that age, eat, drink, and sleep, but do not reproduce normally. Instead, they are created directly by the godlike Eldest who rule the First World, and they serve at the pleasure (or frustration) of these capricious and mysterious entities. Believed to be the most powerful of all the Tane, jabberwocks are typically only ever created with one purpose: to wreak destruction and havoc upon the Material Plane. One of the Eldest might send a jabberwock to devastate a country, continent, or even entire world in order to get revenge for some slight made against them by a single mortal. Sometimes, no specific insult or injury is required, as some of the Eldest resent the very existence of the Material Plane and periodically create jabberwocks simply to express the wrath of the First World against its younger and less chaotic sibling.Once a jabberwock arrives on the Material Plane, its first order of business is to seek out a lair. It prefers dwelling in remote forest locations about a day's flight from civilization—the more dangerous the woodland is to those who might eventually come hunting it, the better! The relationship between jabberwocks and vorpal weapons is the subject of much debate and speculation among scholars, and the various poems, songs, and legends about the jabberwock do little to clarify the issue, conflicting and diverging on this point. Some believe that vorpal weapons were first created specifically to combat jabberwocks, but others take the story one step further. They cite evidence in certain ancient myths that there may once have been only a single, unique jabberwock, so powerful that nothing could so much as scratch it—nothing, that is, except for the first vorpal sword, crafted for that very purpose. So epic was the resulting battle that it created strange echoes throughout reality, and as a result, these echoes, in the form of vorpal weapons, can now be found on many worlds. Those who subscribe to this belief claim that the jabberwocks seen today are but pale imitations of this proto-jabberwock, and they speculate that only the combined efforts of several Eldest would be sufficient to create such a creature again.Variant JabberwocksThe Eldest have sometimes altered certain aspects of the jabberwocks they create. Some of the more notorious or legendary variant jabberwocks include the following.Frumious Jabberwock: Frumious jabberwocks have two heads. They are level 24 and gain an extra action on each of their turns they can use only to make a jaws Strike.Mimsy Jabberwock: Typically hailing from wintry regions of the First World, mimsy jabberwocks have glowing blue-white scales, resist cold instead of fire, and have eyes that burn with blue flames that deal cold damage instead of fire damage.Slithy Jabberwock: Wreaking destruction beneath the waves, these sinuous and slimy jabberwocks are amphibious, have a swim Speed of 80 feet instead of the normal fly Speed, and do not have a wing Strike. A slithy jabberwock's whiffling aura is activated whenever it swims, makes a tail Strike, or Burbles.",,23
Jailer,"A jailer's primary responsibility is to keep prisoners from escaping.

Jann Shuyookh,"Regarded as the progenitors of geniekind, janns hold a position of esteem above the genies tied to specific planes. They possess an inborn ability to grant wishes, which the other branches of geniekind lack and greatly envy. Nomadic jann shuyookhs rarely hold court, preferring to gather only when the need arises to perform great deeds. Lesser janns respect and venerate these leaders for their wisdom and total dedication to preserving the honor and reputation of their people.

They are a proud people and take great care to maintain their honor—restoring that honor with the edge of a sword, if necessary.",Genie,4
Japalisura,"Japalisuras have a perverse propensity for extracting embarrassing truths from the universe, using a combination of artifice and prophecy to obscure the truth and corrupt traditional soothsaying. They have a special talent for manipulation—feeding listeners' worst impulses and prejudices, telling them what their prey most want to hear, and twisting their perceptions to suit the japalisuras' own ends. All this occurs from behind a veil, though, for japalisuras are grotesque fiends with six arms, infinite faces, and an obsession with the profane. The first japalisura rose from the remains of three demigod archers, sons of a goddess who feared their rise to power and slew them. Their merged form was so terrifying that they struck a deal with a powerful asura rana to alter their face into something more pleasing. The true cruelty of the enchantment became clear only later—the japalisura had a new face, but that face transformed into a different one every minute, each more hideous than the last.",Asura,12
Jinkin,"Jinkins are sadistic tinkers who steal and sabotage items and take great pride in their power to curse precious objects. They hold grudges and create convoluted plans for revenge whenever they feel slighted, such as when a creature dares to remove one of their curses. Rarely content to wreak simple mayhem, jinkins also take immense pleasure in torture and murder, though they prefer to lead victims into traps designed to capture or incapacitate rather than kill outright. Deep pits are favorites, since victims who survive the fall face a slow death from starvation and thirst. Jinkins enjoy gathering at the edge of pits to mock, tease, and torment.",Gremlin,1

Jotund Troll,"Jotund trolls are gigantic, nine-headed horrors who prowl frigid moors, marshes, and wastelands, always alone and always enraged. While each of the jotund troll's nine heads possess their own brains and senses, they work much more in tandem than the dual-minded nature of the two-headed troll. Despite this, the heads often argue and bicker, particularly over which head gets to eat. The fact that all nine maws lead to the same shared stomach makes little difference in such culinary disagreements. Prevailing wisdom holds that the jotund troll represents a primordial, if not original, shape and design for the first trolls to plague the world, arising from a mythical realm in the Great Beyond known as Jotungard. This sprawling domain, said to be nestled in a remote reach of Elysium, is the legendary home of the deities of giant-kind. Whether the jotund troll was created in Jotungard to plague the Material Plane as punishment or challenge, or if it's merely an evocative legend told by scholars, is unknown. In any case, the jotund trolls themselves likely care little.",Troll,15
Judge,"These magistrates have the final say on the intent and spirit of the law. Properly exercised, the duty of a judge is the strict adherence to the law regardless of station, with minimal sentimentality toward rationalization and justification of why the law was broken.

In a court case or other legal proceeding, the judge is a 6th-level challenge.",Magistrates,-1
Jungle Drake,"Believed to be related to green dragons, jungle drakes are dangerous hunters equipped with a debilitating venom delivered by a large barbed stinger or their noxious phlegm. Their wings are equipped with vestigial claws that allow them to deftly maneuver through thick jungle foliage both in flight and on foot. Jungle drakes prefer to ambush their prey using hit-and-run tactics, picking off the weakest members of a group and dragging their victims off to finish their meals as they please.",Drake,6
Jyoti,"Jyotis are sometimes called “false phoenixes” (a term they find insulting) by the ignorant or willful. These avian humanoids are native to the Positive Energy Plane. They rarely leave this enigmatic realm and view visitors from other planes as stains on the purity of their home. Jyotis particularly distrust divine spellcasters and religious warriors, seeing them as inclined to take credit for manifesting a life force that, from the jyotis' perspective, is as plentiful and ubiquitous as water is to fish. Despite their distrust of intruders, jyotis rarely attack unprovoked when their homes are not threatened. They are intolerant, however, of those who intrude on the palaces of crystallized light and captured flame in which they dwell. They often chase even those who come bearing gifts away; few visitors have anything they desire, for what they desire most is to be left alone. The jyotis' full wrath is reserved for natives of the Shadow Plane and the Negative Energy Plane. Historically, the promise of battle with the gargoyle-like sceaduinars, whom they consider it their duty to oppose, has been the only thing to lure jyoti armies beyond the Positive Energy Plane.",,9
Kadlaka,"Kadlakas—strong, lanky humanoids with raven-like features—combine the most formidable aspects of talented hunters and airborne scouts, to say nothing of their potent magical powers over thunder and lightning. Though they shy from most humanoids, kadlakas readily form friendships with ravens and other birds, and they sometimes make temporary alliances with people who prove themselves capable stewards of wild animals and the natural order of things. When they do settle on a roost—whether for a single season or a lifetime—kadlakas often position themselves as guardians of a natural feature or local flock. Because a kadlaka's natural form might frighten humanoid travelers, they often take on the guise of a human or other common bipedal ancestry to gain information and pass on warnings.",,4
Kalavakus,"Kalavakuses work as slavers in the Abyss, earning them the alternate moniker of “slaver demons”; these fiends round up captured victims and sell them to other fiends or unscrupulous mortals. Pleas for freedom or clemency fall on deaf ears, as slaver demons consider anyone they can catch and hold to be their rightful property and theirs to sell. Kalavakuses know more than just physical means of restraining slaves; they also know how to fetter a victim’s soul. The most successful slaver demons have vast slave-pits in the Abyss where they keep stables of imprisoned souls.",Demon,10
Kangaroo,"Kangaroos are marsupials distinguished by long faces, large ears, powerful back legs and tails, and a distinctive hopping gait. These generally placid herbivores are shy of other creatures, preferring to live in open grasslands where their keen ears and eyes can spot danger approaching from a distance. Male kangaroos develop powerful front limbs and exhibit a dominance behavior commonly known as “boxing.” When two male kangaroos confront each other, they draw close; they then swat at their opponent with their front claws while also pulling their own heads back out of range. Kangaroos also occasionally rock back on their tails before delivering a blow with their heavily muscled hind legs. The claws on their back legs make these blows particularly deadly, and a kangaroo can disembowel an attacker with a single strike using this tactic. Like other marsupials, female kangaroos carry their young—called joeys—in a pouch on their bellies. They have only one such offspring at a time, although many females have several joeys in quick succession. These social animals largely gather for protection, but their social structures are similar to those found in herds of camels, horses, or pigs. Kangaroos don't make particularly good mounts, but this hasn't stopped the occasional adventurous gnome or halfling from trying. Such an attempt usually results in a seasick and dizzy rider being dumped unceremoniously from the animal's back or pouch, but some druids have found them to be loyal companions. In places where kangaroos are common, the animals are sometimes hunted for meat and can even provide a primary food supply to migratory communities due to their quick reproduction and ability to flee predators. People in other regions consider kangaroos a delicacy and often import their meat as a show of status in wealthy households. Several types of kangaroos have evolved, each living in a slightly different environment. Gray kangaroos are smaller than other varieties and dwell in open woodlands, most commonly on the southern reaches of the continent of Garund. Giant kangaroos, found primarily on the dry steppes of northern Casmaron, grow to twice the size of standard kangaroos, and the thunderous noise of their passing can be heard and felt from miles away. The kangaroo family also has several smaller relatives, including wallabies and pademelons. Some kangaroos exist in captivity in other parts of the world, but attempts to introduce them into other regions have—so far—largely failed. A large kangaroo can reach over 6 feet in height and weighs up to 200 pounds.",,0
Kappa,"Mischievous by nature, kappas delight in playing pranks on unsuspecting travelers. While not overtly malicious, kappa pastimes can be a significant nuisance to their victims, such as stealing the clothes of people while they bathe or snatching up unattended food from campfires. Kappas also enjoy proving their worth in competitions of strength and, despite their propensity for trickery, are known to be honorable competitors who keep their word and remain polite in conversation. While kappas vary in physical attributes from region to region, they're all amphibious, turtle-like humanoids with beaked mouths, webbed hands and feet, and slimy scales that range in color from bluish green to pale yellow. They often have black hair, arranged in a ring to accommodate the central depression atop a kappa's head. Water from a kappa's home lake, stream, or river fills these depressions, or head bowls, which are believed to be the source of their strength. Younger kappa are easily tricked into bowing and accidentally emptying the water out of their own head bowls. Losing this water makes the kappa lethargic. The longer a kappa's head bowl remains empty, the weaker they grow. While this issue rarely poses a serious danger for a kappa living near their home body of water, it can prove fatal to a more adventurous kappa. Kappas aren't inherently hostile and have been known to befriend lonely children and lend aid to stranded adventurers by providing directions or minor medical treatment. Still, many areas known to house kappas have signs both warning of the creatures' presence and encouraging travelers venturing over or through water to first toss in a cucumber, kappas' favorite food, in exchange for safe passage. Kappas put up some of these signs themselves to increase the likelihood of receiving a tasty treat.",,2
Kareq,"A kareq looks like a cross between a dinosaur and an insect. The kareq's torso extends back into a bulbous abdomen like an ant's. A kareq has a resonance chamber in its lower body, and when it flexes its muscular back legs against it, pressure builds up and sound waves are amplified and then focused as the kareq opens its mouth and releases the blast. The resulting shock wave can easily kill. Kareqs are thought to be related to Golarion's destrachans, though their similarities may simply be the result of convergent evolution. Unlike the stronger subterranean destrachans, kareqs are native to a variety of different environments, most often jungles and forests. A few sandy-colored species are found in the deserts of the Colonies, where formians regard the beasts as noble or, in some cases, practically sacred. Kareqs tend to be solitary predators, bold and unafraid, even willing to take on predators significantly larger than themselves. In combat, they keep their distance at first, softening up opponents with their boomstrikes before moving in for the kill with their claws. While they don't usually hunt in populated areas, kareqs are extremely territorial, and their desire to lay claim to tall landscape features can bring them into conflict with humanoids. During mating season, a kareq seeks height, climbing to the top of hills, boulders, or—if a settlement is particularly unlucky—towers and other buildings. From these perches, kareqs blast out their booming mating call which can carry for dozens of miles. A typical kareq stands 5 feet tall at the shoulder and is 10 feet long, weighing up to 300 pounds.",,5

Keketar,"The ruling caste of the proteans, keketars orchestrate attacks against the bastions of law and adjudicate protean disputes confidently and capriciously. A keketar resembles a shimmering, serpentine creature with spines, claws, and a dragon-like head. A keketar’s actual appearance is in constant flux, but they generally stay about 18 feet long with a weight of around 1,500 pounds. While their physical forms can vary, two things remain constant: First, a keketar’s eyes are always a piercing shade of amber or violet. Second, the keketar’s mark of office—a crown of shifting symbols that hovers above its head—never changes. A keketar cannot remove its crown but can suppress it, although most are loath to do so and consider such an act one of cowardice or shame. Keketars fill a role in protean society of a sort of priesthood, operating as intermediaries between the other proteans and the Speakers of the Depths. All other proteans defer to keketars, treating them in a way similar to how citizens of a mortal city would treat respected nobles; even more powerful proteans defer to the will of the keketars. As with many religions, dogma and theology are prone to interpretation and change, and among the proteans the situation is perhaps even more pronounced. Whatever the nature of and desires held by the mysterious Speakers of the Depths, individual keketars may come to dramatically different conclusions as to their will and intent. To the proteans, though, this inherent dissonance is a strength rather than a weakness.",Protean,17
Kelpie,"Kelpies are malevolent amphibious fey shapechangers intent on luring mortals to their doom. These cruel predators lurk in and around areas of water, slightly preferring freshwater over saltwater. Kelpies lure or drag their prey underwater then drown and devour them, leaving behind only the victim's heart and liver— the only parts of a meal kelpies find unpleasant. Kelpies are fond of magically disguising itself as fine steeds or attractive strangers to draw in victims, but its true appearance takes the form of a hideous equine with slimy, green flesh resembling aquatic plants.",,4

Kimenhul,"Among the strongest of their kind aside from the sahkil tormentors, kimenhuls work their craft to foment despair in those who fear failure, forming cycles of self-loathing. These powerful sahkils focus their attention on mortals who are seemingly at the peak of their ability yet harbor secret fears of inadequacy. A kimenhul's predations can leave an indelible mark on its victims. The kimenhul whispers threats and sends fears of crushing failure to its prey, seemingly originating from their own minds, a trauma that can be difficult to bear without help. These sahkils torment their prey as long as the hapless victims live, using their Eternal Fear ability every day to psychically remind their previous victims of their failings. Some unique kimenhuls find themselves in a position of leadership in Xibalba (see the sidebar below), where they carve out their own small kingdoms and direct groups of sahkils to help them find mortals to torment. They rule these nightmare kingdoms through terror, often delighting in tormenting new petitioners or scheming ways to work against their immortal foes.",Sahkil,20
Kinzaruk,"In its natural state, the kinzaruk resembles a paper-thin, perfectly square sheet of lightweight silvery-white metal, approximately 15 feet across. It's almost never encountered this form, however, being far better known for its ability to intricately fold its body thousands of times in an instant to reconfigure itself into a varied assortment of deadly animal-like shapes.","Elemental, Metal",3
Kirin,"The rare and majestic antlered beast known as a kirin supposedly appear only in times of peace and prosperity or during the birth or death of a great sage. Thus, encountering a kirin is a sign of great fortune, success, and prosperity to come. Conversely, finding a kirin's corpse or witnessing their death is a portent of tragedy and misfortune. A kirin's song always precedes the sighting of one of these graceful creatures, a sound often mistaken for wind chimes gently dancing in the breeze. Kirin are chimeric creatures with the body of a stag, the tail of an ox, two horns atop their heads, and the scales and vibrant coloration of a dragon. Their majestic manes and beards constantly flow in the breeze, even on days with no wind, and sometimes appear wreathed in flames. As creatures that treasure life, kirin don't consume flesh, and they take great care not to kill even a single insect beneath their cloven hooves. They're the embodiment of peace yet will quickly strike down evil with a powerful thrust of their horns, knowing that their acts preserve the peace for those who might otherwise come to harm. Legends tell of particularly pious champions who have persuaded kirin to partner with them as mounts, though accomplishing such a feat is even rarer than the kirin.",,7
Kishi,"Kishis are duplicitous and murderous fey who dwell on the edges of Golarion's densest jungles. At first glance, kishis appear to be attractive humans, usually of a local ethnicity, but their full heads of thick hair conceal a second face: that of a snarling hyena. When a kishi lures their prey into a vulnerable situation, their head swivels around, revealing this fearsome visage. In this form, a kishi's powerful jaws are almost impossible to pry loose and can crush a victim's bones in a matter of moments. Kishi range widely in their physical features, and their height and weight vary as much as the people whose communities they infiltrate. They dress in fine clothing aligned with the latest fashion trends, and they wear flashy jewelry with the intention of drawing onlookers' eyes. Like most fey, a kishi has inscrutable motives, though to their victims, the kishi's goal seems simple—to revel in the expression of shock, betrayal, and terror on a victim's face. Although kishis can cast charm to make unwitting companions complacent, most of these sinister creatures prefer to trick their prey using guile, gifts, and their dashing good looks. These ultimate sadists derive pleasure from the thrill of the hunt as well as the delicious reward at the end. The more uptight, prudish, or haughty a target, the better—for nothing satisfies kishis as much as earning (and destroying) the trust of someone who rarely grants it. When kishis get their new friends or lovers alone, they choose the most dramatic moments to reveal their true monstrous forms and clamp their jaws down on their victim. Kishis have no desire to share their true nature with the entire community, so they typically aim for the throats of their victims, who can no longer cry out for help after being cut off from air. Kishis consume every part of their victims' bodies, leaving no trace of the crime—even lapping up any spilled blood, claiming the victim's treasures as their own, and cleaning the murder scene as much as possible. Few things can bind a community together as swiftly as uncovering a kishi. Once found out, a kishi flees, hoping to find a new community to prey upon.",,8
Kithangian,"The kithangian—a horrifying amalgam of horse and scorpion also known as a “beast demon”—is a foul fiend born of the souls of mortals who abused and tormented animals in life. Kithangians tend to roam wild areas rife with animals to torture, though humanoid settlements with plenty of pets or livestock also make for tantalizing hunting grounds. Uncontested for too long, a kithangian's presence has a corrupting influence on the local fauna, which birth fiendish monstrosities until the demon is vanquished. If it realizes it's being tracked by vengeful druids or demon slayers, a kithangian assumes the shape of an unassuming animal so it can get the jump on its pursuers.",Demon,9
Kitsune Trickster,"Kitsune are shapeshifting, fox-like humanoids who have been blessed by the spirits. They can shift from the form of a fox-headed humanoid into a specific alternate form unique to each kitsune, usually either a tailless form—such as a humanoid body without any fox features (typically of the prevalent ancestry where they grew up)—or a fox form. Kitsune revel in joy and beauty, often practicing storytelling, dance, and other creative arts. However, they also have a penchant for playing pranks on the joyless and self-important, earning them a reputation as tricksters. Favored by the goddess Daikitsu, kitsune seem to be almost supernaturally lucky, perpetually dodging danger by the narrowest margins. While kitsune settlements do exist, most kitsune are incredibly curious and often leave home at a young age to encounter new people and sights. Some kitsune spend years in their tailless form, living disguised among humanoids in urban or rural societies whose inhabitants have no clue of their true nature. Others go to the opposite extreme, spending most of their lives in the form of a fox, only to reveal themselves at the most opportune moment. For many kitsune, revealing their true form to someone is a sign of great trust, but it's also not uncommon for kitsune to display their dual nature openly. Kitsune's connection to the spiritual world grants them a number of magical abilities. Aside from their innate shapeshifting powers, kitsune naturally develop more potent magic as they mature, and they seem to effortlessly pick up skills that would rival the most practiced spellcasters. Those who truly apply themselves to honing their magic usually become remarkable at their craft. A kitsune is born with one tail, but as their magical powers grow, so do their number of tails. Elders blessed with great magical wisdom can have as many as nine, though according to popular legend, this level of power can take up to a thousand years to achieve.",Kitsune,2
Kizidhar,"The genies of the Plane of Wood, known as the kizidhars, are overbearing lords of their element. These master crafters of wood specialize in carpentry and all kinds of woodcarving, and they take a particular delight in reshaping the world in their own image—either through creating wooden statues of themselves or by manipulating and controlling the living things around them. Though they're able to carve themselves similarly, they usually regard their own forms as perfect. Shunning the company of other genies, they prefer to avoid those equal in power and instead surround themselves with circles of sycophants and flatterers. With the pathways to the Universe open again for the first time in ages, kizidhars roam the multiverse to find mortals they can tempt into joining their palace retinues as servants, entertainers, and valuable sources of new information.Kizidhars look like walking trees, averaging 10 to 12 feet tall with branches twisting to form their arms, faces, and other features. A kizidhar can reshape their body to create any wooden object.",Genie,6
Kizidhar Shuyookh,"Kizidhar shuyookhs are the powerful rulers of the Glowing Infinity on the Plane of Wood. They view other genies, including other kizidhars, as subservient to their own greatness, manipulating them as though they were outsiders whenever it helps achieve their goals. Kizidhar shuyookh diplomats are sent as emissaries from the Plane of Wood to the Universe, representing the metropolis of Nodollin and Grand Sultana Eshal Muazzam Rayadii of the Glowing Infinity, Lady of All that Grows and Decays.",Genie,11
Kobold Dragon Mage,Kobold dragon mages use magic to carry out their secret schemes. The presence of a dragon mage in a kobold warren is one of the greatest testaments to the kobolds’ claim to draconic heritage.,Kobold,2
Kobold Scout,"Most kobolds encountered outside of a well-defended warren or lair are kobold scouts, creatures trained for stalking and the hunt.",Kobold,1
Kobold Warrior,"The typical kobold trains with agile weaponry, favoring the light pick for its use in crafting new tunnels to expand their domains through underground reaches. Kobolds are capable of landing sneaky strikes against unsuspecting foes but are just as quick to scamper off to safety when they don’t, as a group, outnumber their enemies at least two to one.",Kobold,-1
Kodama,"A kodama is a type of kami who inhabits a tree. Kodama commonly appear in old Tian forests, especially old-growth forests far removed from civilization. In the Forest of Spirits in Minkai, for example, so many trees are possessed by kodama that a traveler might pass by hundreds, if not thousands, of these beings while journeying through a single acre of woodland. Kodama try their utmost to protect their sacred trees, but a single kodama is a minor obstacle to most oni or others who have no qualms about desecrating forests or harvesting them for natural resources. Like trees in a forest, kodama are most powerful in great numbers and among other kami, whom they can bolster with their magical straw ropes while distracting strong enemies with their mesmerizing presence. On the other hand, kodama bear no ill will toward those who respect their wards, even allowing druids and other deferential creatures to dwell within their bounds. They might even subtly guide lost travelers out of the forest or back to safety.",Kami,5
Kokogiak,"As deadly on land as in the water, kokogiaks are one of the most feared predators of the tundra. From a distance they might be mistaken for a frightfully large polar bear, but anyone unfortunate enough to see one up close will notice the creature's six additional legs and disturbingly elongated neck before meeting an untimely end. These ursine monstrosities stalk their prey tirelessly across ice and snow; they're also powerful swimmers, lurking under the ice to burst up and ambush unsuspecting creatures on the surface or diving for a marine meal. As if numerous claws and a brutal bite weren't concerning enough, these nightmare-inducing creatures can be wickedly deceptive, luring their prey out in winter storms. The cunning kokogiak imitates the sounds of a creature in distress, deceiving its target into abandoning the safety of their shelter and embarking on an ill-fated rescue attempt. Those who live in arctic realms have learned to respond with caution upon hearing cries for help during a long winter night.",,12
Kolyarut,"Kolyarut inevitables are enforcers of bargains and punishers of those who fail to uphold them. Their humanoid shape, ability to disguise themselves among a humanoid population, and diplomatic leanings make them the most approachable inevitables, and thus more likely to ally themselves with others. They are among the most talkative of all inevitables, naturally possessing a courtly grace and an encyclopedic knowledge of social customs, which they use to assist their efforts in gathering information on their targets or issuing challenges in a legal manner.",Aeon,12
Kongamato,"Though they resemble pterosaurs and hail from a similar era, kongamatos are actually a primeval branch of dragonkind. They aren't particularly intelligent and lack the powerful magical abilities that many of their dragon kindred command, but a kongamato has a supernaturally strong beak that can punch through incredibly dense substances. While this beak might seem like a valuable trophy for hunters, its magic dies with the kongamato, and all attempts to integrate them into weapons have failed. Though they dwell in swamps and other still waters, kongamatos prefer to hunt in rivers and streams, since running water delivers new prey on a regular basis. The predators hunt everything, and they are well aware their powerful beaks can sink boats and rafts. They even possess a semblance of draconic greed. While they care little for the material wealth or societal power, kongamatos claim large hunting territories, violently attacking any would-be rivals and ravenously slaughtering large animals in their territory, leaving carcasses half-eaten with little regard for whether they'll still have meals in the future. When a kongamato claims a territory that encapsulates a community, the people there have no choice but to hunt down the vicious predator or hire adventurers to do so on their behalf. Kongamatos' hunger is such that a single one can devastate entire herds of livestock and threaten the safety of the entire community. Unlike their draconic relatives, kongamatos ignore attempts to bargain with them, and efforts to appease them through regular sacrifices have no effect.",,11
Korred,"Korreds are reclusive fey in the form of small, hirsute individuals with long, animated manes of hair. While korreds have a natural affinity and admiration for stones and boulders, they prefer to dwell aboveground in areas of rocky forest or wooded hills rather than in caves. Korreds are a private people who don't take kindly to intruders, and they invariably work to drive off or kill any non-fey who stumble into their territory. Staunchly proud of their hair, korreds choose their minimal attire so as to allow their body hair to flow freely, often wearing only a belt with a pouch for throwing rocks and trimming shears—though this belt and pouch are rarely visible under their wild manes.",,4
Kovintus Geomancer,"Kovintus are reclusive humanoids with an inborn talent for geomancy that ties them intrinsically to nature. Not only can they call upon the magic of nature, it also calls to them in return, turning them into an element of the surrounding terrain when they die. One of the strongest traditions in kovintus culture is making maps to chronicle the places their loved ones have become one with the landscape. Kovintus live in small groups in natural places far from larger civilizations. A typical kovintus settlement consists of natural houses built into the environment around a central meeting place. The form fits the terrain, with dwellings nestled into crags on a mountain or forming a windbreak on a plain. Though kovintus beliefs can greatly differ based on their home terrain, many of these creatures believe their intrinsic commonality through nature links them more intimately than such superficial differences. Once, all kovintus lived in their ancient home, the Valley—a place of bounty and natural splendor unheard of in the modern world. This paradise was lost in ancient times, and the kovintus set out in small groups to find new homes. Today, any valley kovintus come upon is called merely an “echo” of the true Valley. Rather than seeking their original valley, kovintus believe the cycles of nature will someday bring about a new home with the same grandeur. Kovintus faith calls for respect rather than reverence. When traveling away from home, kovintus believe it's crucial to respect any local deities who have built the land they stand upon, and pay them tribute with small offerings.",Kovintus,3
Kraken,"A kraken is an enormous, squid-like leviathan with a cruel intelligence. It hunts ships, whales, and heroes alike. The hatred and envy krakens hold for their rivals, the alghollthus, has led many krakens to make their lairs in sunken cities, where they can sift through ancient lore for long-lost arcane secrets.",,18
Krooth,"Krooths, sometimes called crocodile eaters, are fast and vicious hunters of bogs and wetlands. While they are known to hunt and eat crocodiles, alligators, and virtually any creature with flesh, their favorite prey are lizardfolk, boggards, and dinosaurs. Krooths are found alone or in packs. Male krooths are solitary and territorial creatures—fierce, bold, and bloodthirsty. Female krooths, on the other hand, are likely to shy away from potential predators but swiftly turn violent when their brood is threatened. Because their offspring are so vulnerable, female krooths gather in packs to raise their young, sending smaller groups to hunt for food while the rest of the pack watches the brood. Krooths mate only once every 4 or 5 years, and the mating process is a curiously gruesome spectacle. An entire pack of females will hunt as a group for a lone male krooth, claiming their prize in an orgiastic frenzy that can last for an entire day and night. After the mating has finished, the females slay their mate and devour his nutrient-rich flesh, and his organs in particular. These organs contain a unique chemical compound vital to gestation. Many naturalists will pay handsomely for the fresh remains of a male krooth so they can study the strange properties of the creature’s blood and organs. In addition, krooths have poisonous, hollow teeth. When these creatures bite their prey, a tooth breaks off and causes the victim to bleed profusely as their blood pours through the hollow tooth. Whether male or female, krooths seem to be repelled by goblinoid flesh, especially that of bugbears. This doesn’t mean krooths won’t kill goblinoids, especially those threatening their young, but they typically do so using only their claws and tails, and they take great care to clean themselves thoroughly after such a killing.",,8
Kuchisake-Onna,"A kuchisake-onna, or slit-mouthed woman, is a tall, masked figure who moves with an eerie grace. These horrors are infamous for trapping hapless mortals and asking them, “Am I pretty?” A “no” response leads to a gruesome death wrought by the silver scissors the kuchisake-onna carries. A “yes” prompts them to remove their mask, revealing the scars and cuts running from ear to ear, giving the impression of a terrible, ever-present grin. They then open their mouth to reveal sharp, needle-like teeth and ask another question: “Even now?” A “no” leads to the same gory death, while a “yes” prompts them to use their silver scissors and make the same cuts on the target's face while repeating: “Then I will make you like me.” There are a handful of methods to weasel out of this otherwise no-win scenario. Answering noncommittally, saying the kuchisake-onna looks “okay,” or throwing several small, countable objects like rice or candy often provides enough time to run while the monster is distracted. Few are foolish enough to attack the kuchisake-onna, and those that live to tell the tale speak of a flashing flurry of scissor blades that match even a swordmaster's prowess.",,14
Kun,"Hungry and resentful, the malevolent kun is a mythological fish monster that dwells in the remotest, coldest depths of the ocean. This massively powerful creatures could easily rule a subaquatic domain if they cared to, but kuns are also famous for their total self-absorption and complete ambivalence toward other forms of life. A kun remains as far away from other creatures as they can, subsisting on only their own icy hatred. They can consume and digest prey, but such feedings are incidental. Most kuns remain ignorant and uncaring, keeping themselves in the dark, disregarding any signs of life around them except to occasionally lash out with a spiteful attack.",,14
Kurobozu,"A monk who violated their monastic vows in life might arise after death to become an undead horror known as a kurobozu. These predators feast upon the breath of mortals, creeping on twisted limbs into bedrooms to steal the life from sleeping victims. This act of feeding leaves its mark on the victim in the form of a vile scent of rot on the victim's breath and a debilitating disease that eventually results in exhaustion and finally death. Kurobozus retain echoes of their ascetic training, enabling them to suck the breath from debilitated foes in the midst of battle. Their malevolent cunning combined with ascetic discipline helps them concoct elaborate and lengthy schemes to enact their jealous revenge. Few kurobozus are convincing enough to persuade their onetime allies to break their own oaths, but this doesn't stop them from making the attempt.",,6
Kushtaka,"Kushtaka, or “land otters” as they are sometimes known, are devious shapeshifters. They propagate by luring a humanoid away from the shelter of their home and slowly transforming the kidnapped creature into a new kushtaka. Kushtaka have an easier time transforming willing prey, so they prefer to use their shapeshifting ability and innate magical powers to convince their chosen targets to follow them away to a kushtaka village. Once a humanoid has been lured to a kushtaka village, they slowly begin to change, a bit at a time, until their body transforms fully into that of a kushtaka and ejects their mortal soul. These ejected souls often linger before giving rise to ghosts or haunts, though the kushtaka themselves are unaware of the souls' presence, having completely forgotten who they once were due to the magic that transformed them. Kushtaka can be a scourge to small human villages, slowly pilfering villagers away one person at a time. This might mean the kushtaka village displaces the human one, or leaves the human village unable to survive with too small a population to hunt, fish, defend against threats, or raise the next generation.",,4
Kvernknurr,"Kvernknurrs are lanky fey giants that dwell in cold-water rivers and lakes. A kvernknurr's blue flesh allows it to camouflage itself in its preferred environ, where it haunts local millers and farmers by sabotaging water wheels and farm equipment. A kvernknurr's most distinguishing feature is its oversized mouth and the two rows of axe-like teeth therein. To eat, a kvernknurr need only unhinge its lower jaw, revealing in the process a yawning portal nearly the size of a human doorway—convenient, considering its favorite food is humans and their ilk. A lake- or riverbed is the perfect place for a kvernknurr to sleep off a big meal. It's also a perilous circumstance for swallowed prey lucky enough to escape the kvernknurr's belly. “Out of the belly, into the water,” goes one lakeside village saying. Kverknurrs despise humanoid-made disturbances to the waters in which they live, even seemingly harmless ones like waterwheels. In their anger, kvernknurrs use their oversized jaws to clamp down on such machinery. When townsfolk come to investigate their jammed mill, the kvernknurr then springs out from hiding to attack, roaring terribly before snatching a victim to eat whole. Folks brave enough to attack a kvernknurr soon learn to fight up close; the wily monster is quick enough to snatch arrows and spears in its jaws midair before swallowing the weapons down.",,5
Lacedon,"Feared by mariners and coastal dwellers everywhere, the aquatic ghouls known as lacedons are said to be the spawn of an ancient crew of sailors who became lost at sea and were forced to resort to cannibalism to survive. Their appearance is the stuff of a diver's nightmare, supplementing the vicious traits of their land-bound kin with spines, fins, and wide mouths bristling with needle-sharp teeth like piscine predators of the nethermost ocean depths.",Ghoul,2
Lagofir,"Lagofirs are semiaquatic omnivores that resemble a rabbit the size of a large dog. They're social creatures, playful but territorial and protective of their kin. Lagofirs live in family units and gather in larger groups as often as their environment allows. They're commonly found in northern Avistan, congregating along rivers, lakes, and coasts, where they subsist on fish, crustaceans, marine plants, and small mammals. Lagofirs have a stout body, rounded back, large hind legs, long ears, and a short, fluffy tail. Their powerful incisors are capable of cracking through clam shells, chitin, and bone. Both their front and back paws are webbed, and their front paws are highly dexterous, enabling them to grasp objects and perform simple manual tasks. Lagofirs secrete a thick, sweet-smelling, flammable oil that coats their fur. Warm to the touch, this oil keeps them insulated and comfortable in frigid water and cold climates. Lagofirs mark their territory by brushing against solid surfaces, coating them in oil that, to other lagofirs, identifies an individual. This makes their lairs, known as burrows or forms, incredibly hazardous. A single spark in a lagofir form can cause an explosion.",,3
Lamia,"Just as they were cursed long ago, lamias can curse those they touch, clouding the mind and regressing conscious thought to purely animalistic instincts. Creatures affected by this curse grow reckless, becoming unaware of the consequences of their own actions and unable to think clearly. This makes the hapless victim all the more susceptible to the lamia's cunning illusions and insidious charms. The lamia's animalistic nature and the effect of their cursed touch has led some scholars to theorize that the original lamias must have, millennia ago, turned away from their own reason and intellect and embraced the life of simple beasts. Whether this change was rewarded as a monstrous gift from Lamashtu or inflicted as a curse for abandoning their responsibilities by Pharasma remains the subject of debate to this day. Whatever the source of this ancient transformation, lamias themselves have grown to enjoy the strengths it has granted them. Regardless, they continue to cling to a hatred of the gods, seeing them as the cause of their monstrous forms and, thus, their eternal exile from the societies they watch with jealous eyes from their lairs amid the ruins of lost civilizations. Because lamias blame divine powers for their curse, they take special delight in the downfall of temples, the suffering and death of champions and clerics, and the spread of dissension within organized religions. While they can briefly assume humanoid form with magic, lamias are usually forced to hide from civilization, making their homes in the barren wilderness. There, they attract cults of their own, gathering up chaotic and evil humanoids. With the help of these cultists, lamias strive to bring down popular faiths, introduce schisms into flourishing churches, and humiliate or defame high-profile religious leaders. Most lamias themselves have no true religious faith in anything, hearing instead a mystical calling that manifests as sighs on the desert wind or murmurs from the dark places between the stars. Lamias are traditionally matriarchal, revering the eldest female among them as leader, mother, and shaman.",Lamia,6
Lamia Matriarch,"The brilliant and powerful lamia matriarchs possess boundless ambition, always seeking to bring more people and territory into the clutches of their kind. Consequently, the become rulers of other lamia. For all their cruelty toward other creatures, they’re fierce protectors of other lamia, and consequently they quickly come to rule cults or warbands. Regardless of the lamia’s gender, these ascended lamias are always known as matriarchs. Rather than leonine limbs, a lamia matriarch’s lower body is formed in the winding coils of a giant snake. They’re also set apart by the occult power they pursue, and some have even have grand designs to break the animalistic curse that transformed them. However, every attempt so far has led to the matriarch’s fall.",Lamia,8
Lampad,"Lampads protect dark, hidden places underground. Not only do they defend subterranean caverns from threats, but they also safeguard well-meaning innocents from the dangers that lurk below the surface. Lampads are so-named for the wisps of magic light they often carry, guiding the lost to safety while luring threats to their doom. Lampads' mercurial nature makes their reactions difficult to predict, though they rarely demonstrate outright malice without sufficient provocation.",Nymph,5
Lampad Queen,"Lampad queens are capricious monarchs and protectors of vast underground domains, regarded in ballads and tales as allies and foes, monsters and muses. Lampad queens have a particular animosity for the many predominantly evil underground ancestries, such as drow and duergar, and they are particularly fond of bats. Many lampad queens have nykteras (page 254) as favored attendants.",Nymph,15
Lantern Archon,"Friendly, curious, and eternally optimistic, lantern archons embody the virtue of hope. They are formed of living light given corporeal shape, and they serve as beacons, guiding mortals out of their darkest moments and toward the path of righteousness. Their luminous bodies can flicker with the subtlety of a candle flame or flare up like a torch. Lantern archons can control all aspects of their light as easily as other creatures control their facial expressions, leading them to change color, twinkle, and otherwise dim and brighten in time with their actions and words. While effervescent and chipper in conversation, lantern archons are impressively stoic mobile support troops and guardians in times of conflict, and are capable of uniting to form powerful warriors of light called gestalts.",Archon,1
Last Guard,"Honor and broken oaths bind a last guard to a location they failed to defend in life. There they must keep watch until their duties are fulfilled or they are swayed by a compelling call to war, departing to march to battle.",,20
Lava Otter,"These fiery otters frolic and hunt in the lava streams of the Plane of Fire. They're known to be highly territorial, instigating fights with rival otter families to compete for territory. Cautiously curious of strangers, entire packs have been known to descend upon anyone who attacks or event accidentally threatens a family member.","Elemental, Fire",1

Ledalusca,"Ledaluscas are reflective water elementals that can bring forth images previously reflected on their surfaces and wholly freeze themselves in the shapes of what they reflected. They explore and protect the calmest boundaries of the icy regions of the Plane of Water, where ice forms in shiny, flawless sheets. Insatiably curious, their eagerness propels some ledaluscas to pickpocket interesting-looking objects to play with. Others travel to different planes to locate, observe, and reflect a wider variety of creatures than those on their home plane. They pretend to be ice sculptures or still pools for this purpose, especially if they can find a spot in a high-traffic area to inhabit. Despite their perfect mimicry, ledaluscas are unable to create an appearance from scratch, nor can they adjust the appearance they take on or combine elements of different reflections. Some of them find this disheartening, like artists vexed by a lack of creativity. One of the strangest encounters a ledalusca can experience is with a creature or object that has no reflection. A ledalusca can see a vampire, for example, but is unable to reproduce its image. For a creature that effectively has an unlimited memory for images, this proves utterly confusing. The vague memory of the encounter sticks in the ledalusca's mind like a splintering a humanoid's finger.",,2
Legion Archon,"Despite their flaming blades and heavy armor, legion archons are the diplomats of peace among the archons, preferring justice via compromise and mutual benefit rather than justice by the sword. Nonetheless, when forced to fight against fiendish powers—especially fiends that embody the sin of wrath—legion archons don’t hesitate in battle, mounting offensives under divine commanders like Iomedae.",Archon,7
Lemure,"These shapeless masses of quivering flesh are the least of devilkind. Pathetic creatures from Hell's first layer, lemures roam alongside damned and suffering souls.

Leprechaun,"Leprechauns are mostly jovial tricksters who prefer mischief over conflict. They fill their days with as much fun, wine, and food as possible. Mostly found in forested regions, leprechauns respect nature and those who protect it. Leprechauns do not attack on sight. Rather, they engage in conversation and try to charm, cajole, or trick those they meet into doing favors for them or freely giving over a treasured item, usually in return for illusory wealth or false promises of wealth and success. These small tricksters are masters at discerning the desires of those they meet—a knack that puts them in a powerful position when bargaining for goods or favors. They aren't above turning people against each other for their own benefit but generally not to an extent that causes harm. In most cases, a leprechaun doesn't keep a purloined possession for long. The leprechaun most often returns such stolen prizes just in time to defuse tensions, often as they point out the humor of the situation, hoping to share their amusement and mirth with the victim. In cases where a leprechaun's trick goes too far and results in an incensed victim, the leprechaun quickly flees the conflict rather than engage in combat. This willingness to return stolen goods or to flee from battles fades as leprechauns grow older. Ancient leprechauns who have lived for thousands of years often spiral into dark bitterness and increasingly use their powers and illusions to lure those who offend them or fail to appreciate a joke into danger... or even death.",,2
Lerritan,"Lerritans are unstoppable giants with skin of volcanic glass and blood of roiling lava. These malicious arsonists would see the world burned to a cinder. They pay homage to Ymeri, the evil elemental demigod of fire, and they bully other fiery creatures. When the urge to immolate grows too great to ignore, lerritans burn forests, destroy villages, and boil rivers, but they avoid large bodies of water.",,21
Lesser Death,"No one is quite sure what lesser deaths are, though some claim that they are avatars of the grim reaper. Unlike that strange hunter, however, lesser deaths hunt in packs on rare occasions. More often than not, they manifest from cursed magic items. Other times, they are just the enactors of death, hunting in the same way the grim reaper does— silently, with neither remorse nor quarter. Rarely, multiple lesser deaths work together to cull a large population, their scythes cutting through crowds and leaving entire cities devoid of life, inspiring (hopefully) false rumors of multiple grim reapers.",Grim Reaper,16
Leucrotta,"The vile and vicious offspring of a demon lord and a monstrous species of hyenas, leucrottas are intelligent and cruel beasts. They use their astounding vocal mimicry to lure unsuspecting creatures near so that they can first torment and then devour them. Leucrottas measure 5 feet at the shoulder and weigh 800 pounds, and they are perpetually filthy. A leucrotta's oversized jaws are lined with rows of jagged, hardened bony ridges rather than teeth, and it can shear through flesh, bone, and even steel with ease.",,5
Leukodaemon,"These skull-headed, vulture-winged daemons are harbingers of pestilence and servants of their patron Horseman, Apollyon. Manifestations of evil souls who perished from disease in life, leukodaemons work tirelessly to spread disease across all the worlds of the multiverse. More than any other daemon, leukodaemons cooperate with each other and those who conjure them to mortal worlds to spread sickness and plague, eschewing personal glory for end results.",Daemon,9
Levaloch,"Fearsome giants of jagged iron, levalochs serve in the armies of Hell as potent warriors and tenacious hunters—creatures of absolute discipline endlessly obedient to diabolical tyrants.",Devil,7
Leydroth,"In ancient times, a cabal of primalists imbued an amalgam of beasts with both supernatural might and a hatred of magic itself, hoping to achieve a potent weapon for use against arcane spellcasters. Effective beyond expectation, the first leydroths broke free and turned on their creators. Worse, the leydroths bred true, and these reclusive predators have long outlived their original creators. Leydroths look like distorted, apelike felines with many-branching horns growing from the backs of their heads. Their thickly muscled limbs end in glowing claws.",,17
Librarian,"Keepers of knowledge, librarians document discoveries, events, and laws. The best librarians record events twice; once for public record, and again to record how events truly unfolded. A librarian typically knows four to six additional languages, often including Elven and Draconic. A librarian is a 3rd-level challenge for encounters involving research.",Scholars,-1
Lich,"A wizard whose insatiable desire for arcane power eclipsed their mortal life, the lich is a truly devious and versatile spellcaster.",Lich,12
Lifeleecher Brawler,"Lifeleechers are mortic orcs with gray flesh, sharp claws, and protruding tusks. Resilient and strong, they devour the vital essence of their enemies, which heals their wounds and shackles those souls to the lifeleecher. Many orcs believe lifeleechers are possessed by the spirits of fallen orc warriors too stubborn to die. Feared and revered, lifeleechers often rise to positions of power in their holds and battle on the front lines against the undead armies of the Whispering Tyrant.",Mortic,8
Lillend,"Lillends are tale-tellers, chroniclers, and champions of freedom of expression. They are generally peaceful, but are quick to act if a masterful piece of art is threatened or free speech is suppressed. They pride themselves on inspiring mortals to greater heights of expression and creativity, and more than one bard looks to a lillend as their personal inspiration. Lillends sometimes secretly follow the adventures of mortal heroes to record their stories as epic poems and songs, which they then perform in the packed mead halls of Elysium. When pursuing such goals, lillends take pains to use their innate spells to remain in hiding, as they would rather observe and record events without “polluting” them with their own intervention. Nevertheless, a lillend who sees their charge faced with certain death often cannot resist the urge to intervene and save the day. Inevitably, this brings a close to the lillend’s chronicles, as their relationship with their subject invariably shifts from one of detached observation to friendship or more. Yet lillends remain hesitant to involve themselves for overlong in a mortal’s life, in part because they fear what sort of fiendish attention their presence might attract, but mostly out of respect for the mortal’s own destiny. A lillend would, all things being equal, prefer to let mortals choose their own fate rather than run the risk of sending someone down a path to which their heart is not set.",Azata,7
Lion,"Lions are cooperative hunters, ambushing dangerous prey in groups of lionesses that work in tandem to trap and kill their prey. Male lions are typically larger, with long manes, and when they hunt, they tend to do so on their own.",Cat,3
Lion Visitant,Scars and other marks of obvious mistreatment are the clearest indicators that an undead animal is no mere zombie.,Visitant,5
Lithic Locus,"Civilizations die, buried by time, but their memory may yet linger in shattered pottery, collapsed edifices, and destroyed artwork, compressed and clarified under the weight of rock and soil. Some excavated sites might still hold a sliver of consciousness in their base materials, which walks again as an avatar of an extinct people when awakened. These lithic loci represent the triumphs and folly of their society. Speaking to one is speaking to a witness of an archaic time. The lithic locus's persona expresses their culture in all dimensions, and thus the attitudes of lithic loci vary greatly. Their appearances show the aesthetics and technology of their time, suspended in a cloud of excavated earth. As plentiful as archaeological sites are in the Universe, the Plane of Earth holds countless more of far older provenance. Some of its inhabitants have even found lithic loci from peoples far older than themselves, seeing directly what would remain should they dwindle out of living memory. This has led some civilizations to even plan their decline by leaving a legacy in the living rock.",,14
Little Man in the Woods,"A murdered man left unburied in the wilds might return as a being called a “little man in the woods,” his decayed corpse shriveling until it shrinks to the size of a child. Denied the respect of a burial that would smooth his spirit's transition to the afterlife, he is unable to leave the mortal plane and enter the realm of the spirits. Forgotten, lost, and miserable, suffering from unbearable hunger and cold, the little man in the woods is desperate to return to his mortal home and be laid to rest properly. Despite his understandable motives, the little man in the woods has degenerated into a foul, twisted creature. He deceives travelers with plaintive cries then begs them to lead him to a home he barely recalls. He strangles all who can't or won't aid him, including those who lead him to the wrong home or otherwise delay his journey. The little man in the woods lays his victims' bodies out in the wilds, leaving the corpse unburied and exposed. He guards these rotting corpses over years as they shrivel and decay, until each one rises as another little man in the woods. Like any of the actions he has been compelled to perform, creating more of his kind brings the little man in the woods no pleasure.",,6
Living Boulder,"Living boulders roll and glide through the Plane of Earth, gathering gemstones and metal shards until their surfaces resemble a ship's hull covered in barnacles. Barely more intelligent than many animals, living boulders fill much the same role on the Plane of Earth as the great herd animals found on Material Plane worlds.","Elemental, Earth",2
Living Grove,"A living grove is a singular connected entity, with dozens of genetically identical trunks united within the same root system. At rest, a living grove resembles nothing so much as a small arboretum of birch and aspen trees, though oak and redwood varieties that are significantly larger and tougher exist as well.","Elemental, Wood",5

Living Lodestone,"This rotating sphere of dark, shiny metal floats about 5 feet off the ground, constantly surrounded by a whirling frenzy of smaller metallic objects caught up in its powerful magnetic field.","Elemental, Metal",6
Living Magma,Living magmas can lie dormant for centuries below the earth before they awaken from their slumber in a fiery a volcanic eruption. This is especially dangerous when entire colonies of the molten elementals arise at the same time.,"Elemental, Fire",13
Living Sap,"The tall sharinga trees of the Mwangi Expanse leak golden sap from their swollen, bulbous trunks, which coagulates when exposed to air. The toxic resin, which has a bitter taste, protects the tree from herbivorous insects and other animals, but in rare cases—usually in areas awash in positive energy or the influence of the First World—the sap gains a life of its own. Such “living sap” is a mindless ooze that attempts to smother and engulf just about anything that moves, from the bugs and small beasts that feed on its sharinga tree to larger creatures unlucky enough to stumble upon it. Due to its immunities to most forms of physical damage and its protectiveness of its mother tree, a living ooze is a nuisance to communities that rely on the sap of sharinga trees to make resin, rubber, and glue. Jungle-dwelling alchemists such as gripplis cherish the sap of the sharinga tree for its unique adhesive properties. The sap has been used for centuries to create tanglefoot bags, glue, and hard resin. Residue collected from a living sap is even more fascinating from an alchemical standpoint. Though harvesting a living sap is very dangerous, some alchemists will risk death (if not their own, then that of hearty adventurers for hire) in order to procure these easily worked ingredients. To increase the odds of a successful harvest, such employers are often willing to supply offensive aids such as lesser frost vials; living sap hunters learned long ago that cold energy is effective against these creatures and luckily doesn’t harm the harvestable reagents.",,6

Lizardfolk Defender,"The lizardfolk defender serves as a protector of the young, guardian of the settlement, and when no other options are available, soldier in time of war. They eagerly rise to the defense of their kin but do not revel in battle. An iruxi defender would rather turn back intruders and allow them to flee with the knowledge they were beaten, in hopes that such word prevents further invasions, but they are not naive. The iruxi understand the need for revenge, and when they allow a foe to escape, they do not forget.",Lizardfolk,1
Lizardfolk Scout,"Iruxi scouts are the lizardfolk most often encountered by adventurers, for these explorers and hunters spend most of their lives on the move, constantly patrolling the territories held by their enclave. If intruders are driven off, it is the responsibility of the iruxi scouts to track them, observe them, and learn their ways and weaknesses so as to report back to the community and aid in the defense against potential reprisals.",Lizardfolk,1
Lizardfolk Stargazer,"The tradition of astrology and looking to the stars for both navigation and prognostication is well-established in iruxi society, and their wise and observant stargazers are among the people’s most respected members. Even the lowliest stargazer, as presented here, has a number of useful primal spells to aid their kin; in larger iruxi settlements, stargazers wield even greater powers.",Lizardfolk,2
Llorona,"Vengeful spirits called lloronas arise from people who died overcome with the grief and shame that comes with the tragic drowning of a child. In life, a llorona may have contributed to the child's death or simply lost the child to a horrible accident. In death, a llorona's pain manifests as a malevolent desire to drown others, imparting the same grief that they share with the person's loved ones. To this end, lloronas remain along riversides and other bodies of water in hopes of drawing their next victim and compelling them to drown themselves. Lloronas look much like they did in life, except they wear elegant funeral attire in undeath. Though stories typically describe lloronas as women, reports from seasoned adventurers include accounts of lloronas appearing as different genders and with a variety of appearances.",,12
Loblobi,"In the First World, rivers don't always flow as expected; sometimes they run backward, upward, or just disappear into mist and reappear somewhere else entirely. Fey native to such rivers are often just as capricious. This quality is particularly true of loblobis, cunning carnivores who resemble small, chubby humans with the heads and wings of crested herons. These malicious tricksters love playing any pranks that result in other creatures being embarrassed, hurt, or even drowned. Their most common “antic” is to cast water walk on a hopeful river-crosser, only to dismiss the spell when their victim has traversed halfway across. Conversely, most loblobis are terrible sports when they're the butt of a joke. It's common wisdom that few creatures can hold a grudge like a loblobi. Exceptionally vain, loblobis flutter and dance constantly to show off their plumage. Failing to comment on a preening loblobi's appearance is a sure method to invite eternal enmity, but flattery might buy enough time to sneak away from the evil fey.",,1
Locathah Hunter,"Deep in the sea, schools of locathah—piscine humanoids armed with spears and specialized crossbows—stalk sharks, sea serpents, and giant squid from the backs of their giant moray eel mounts. The first hunters to strike are armed with barbed harpoons that deploy large fans of seaweed, slowing and exhausting their prey. A daring few locathahs use the embedded harpoon as a handle to ride prey for a short time. Once the creature is tired, remaining hunters finish it with longspears. Locathahs developed this hunting tradition to forge skilled warriors and deter potential attackers, partially in response to centuries of oppression and mistreatment from other aquatic cultures. Locathahs rarely hunt land-dwellers, instead offering to trade their services as guides in exchange for metal and ceramic items they can't build underwater—and for tubers, which they consider earthy delicacies. They render aid to damaged sailing ships and rescue shipwrecked sailors, providing food and guidance. Locathah communities—usually villages of 200 individuals or fewer—are matriarchal. The ruler is also as its primary egg-layer, providing each generation with powerful familial bonds. The communities are tight-knit and loyal. Matriarchs are advised and assisted by primal spellcasters and healers, who are often accompanied by octopus companions.",Locathah,3
Lomori Sprout,"Lomori sprouts are passionate gardeners who closely tend new growth on the Plane of Wood. Incredibly industrious, they lovingly guide young plants into elaborate constructions and patterns, forming tree tunnels, spiraling fields of flowers, complex hedge mazes, towering tapestries of interwoven bamboo, and other dizzying creations. Lomori sprouts meticulously collect the trimmings, seeds, and debris from the flora in their care. They plant the seeds to yield new growth and frenetically weave the rest into nests, spheres, and other simple objects. They're shy and skittish, often losing themselves in their labors, but they're always friendly to those who treat their gardens with respect. Lomoris are aeon spirits dispatched to the elemental planes long ago to pursue the act of creation. While most of the aeons dispatched to the other elemental planes performed their duties and rejoined their aeon brethren, those on the Plane of Wood lingered, becoming trapped as the plane receded. Over the ages, they adapted and evolved into lomoris. Today, lomoris have more in common with the other denizens of the Plane of Wood than they do with their aeon ancestors. Lomori sprouts, much like conrasus, have a central black sphere, known as a lomori's core, that functions as their primary body and consciousness. Where conrasus forge a sturdy exoskeleton, lomoris cultivate a tall mound of prairie grass surrounding their core, which easily grows to be 2–3 times the core's height. The lomori shapes the mound as it grows, creating protective layers to guard their core and forming other useful appendages. Most lomoris have six intricately detailed, crab-like legs of wood that emerge from the lower half of their core, allowing them to rapidly scuttle across the ground or climb trees.",,3
Long-Horned Bison,"Much like their smaller bison cousins, long-horned bison are bovines with short faces, two horns, a shaggy coat, and a noticeable hump on their back. Despite their relation to more placid bovines, however, long-horned bison are ill-tempered and territorial. Their tread shakes the ground, while the thunder of their stampedes can be mistaken for an earthquake. Long-horned bison weigh upwards of 4,500 pounds and measure up to 9 feet tall and 16 feet long. Their horns, measured tip to tip, can be almost as wide as the bison are tall.",,6
Lophiithu,"Lophiithus dwell in the deepest ocean trenches, places untouched by light, hope, or mortal comprehension. They appear to be gaping maws with distended jaws, vestigial flaps of putrefying flesh, and filamentous tentacles tipped with glowing light. Their extraplanar mouths take up most of their bodies, leaving no room for other organs, and any prey they swallow is transported to the Maelstrom for digestion.",,21
Love Siktempora,"Acts of great and intense love spawn love siktemporas, kindly creatures bearing intense strength that start and end wars in the name of the love that birthed them. These adept combatants form crossbows and bolts out of their emotional bonds, though they typically fight only to protect that which they love. While unable to speak given their featureless faces, they're nevertheless compassionate listeners and savvy communicators. Each love siktempora takes the form of two small humanoids conjoined at the hip with three legs, two arms, and two heads. Their faces are completely featureless except for a faint, ever present blush spread across their cheeks, and they always appear garbed in stylish garments from obscure civilizations.",Siktempora,16
Lovelorn,"A particularly macabre form of undead, these spiderlike creatures resemble still-beating hearts with rib bones for legs and tendrils of gore dangling beneath. Their twisted forms hint at their ghastly origin, as these undead form from those who die tragic deaths in service to toxic love: star-crossed lovers who die rather than accept a life apart from one another, rejected suitors whose unrequited affections warp into malice, and other victims of tragic relationships both romantic and otherwise. Any of these might spawn a lovelorn in death, their anguish and fixation on their broken heart causing the organ to animate. A freshly spawned lovelorn often seeks out those it knew in life, stalking and tormenting them or, in some cases, those around them. In undeath, they gain an understanding of emotions and how to manipulate them, cultivating the misery, anger, and cruelty they thrive upon. Typically, these undead long to enact vengeance upon those they feel drove them to their tragic fates, although in rare cases they may instead act as dark guardians, fixating on a particular loved one and “protecting” them by visiting misery upon anyone who slights them.",,4
Luminous Ooze,"Luminous oozes are strange globular creatures that glow with brilliant multicolored light. Unlike many oozes, which rely on camouflage and stealth to attack their prey, luminous oozes attract victims with their impressive light displays before blinding them and launching into a frenzied attack. They are often found on the ceilings or walls of dark caverns, and more than a few curious spelunkers have met their end simply by investigating their strange yet beautiful light. The effects of electricity on luminous oozes are ill understood, though those who have studied these creatures liken their static-absorbing power to that of lightning rods. These creatures are highly sought after by status-hungry socialites, flamboyant barkeeps, and daring showrunners, for in addition to being dangerous monsters, luminous oozes are also incredible sources of beautiful prismatic light, comparable to a magical light show but available for a fraction of the price. The trick, of course, is capturing and penning such a specimen. The most reliable means of caging a luminous ooze is with a permanent wall of force shaped into a cube or sphere, but few have the means to create or commission such an enclosure. Instead, most people who find themselves in possession of a luminous ooze simply put it in a thick glass box. As long as they are well fed, luminous oozes accept this treatment, though woe be unto anyone in the vicinity if a hungry luminous ooze should escape from its display case.",,4
Lunar Naga,"Lunar nagas are skilled diviners and astrologers whose dark scales and white hair sparkle with motes of light that mimic the night skies to which they are forever drawn. While they are less physically imposing than other nagas, they possess a graceful beauty that many find entrancing, even without the help of the naga's inherent magical abilities. Earning a lunar naga's trust is difficult, but not impossible, especially for someone who shares the creature's interest in the celestial sphere. As they have no hands, lunar nagas use mage hand to manipulate delicate instruments and fine telescopes to observe the night sky. They track the positions of celestial bodies, recording their discoveries in esoteric journals. At their best, lunar nagas are wise and mysterious beings who seek to expand their knowledge of the cosmos. At their worst, after too much exposure to the unfathomable entities that dwell in the darkness between the stars, they become dark prophets who drive others to commit terrible deeds in the name of abominable masters. On Golarion, the lunar nagas of the nation of Nagajor use their abilities to serve many communities as soothsayers. A few have founded observatories in which they and their followers explore the night sky. Some nagas even use their knowledge of the stars as navigators on ships or overland caravans. In the broader world, where people do not give nagas deference as nearly divine rulers, lunar nagas try to avoid contact with outsiders or use their magical powers of disguise to hide their true forms from all but their most worthy allies.",Naga,6
Lurker In Light,"These malicious and strange fey appear as fairies about 2 feet tall, with insectile wings, large eyes, and bulbous heads. They slaughter and cause mischief in a pattern only their alien intellect understands, but they've been seen to take particular umbrage against dwarves, gnomes, and creatures who live in darkness. With their grudges and pursuit of their own wicked and sadistic whims, lurkers in light deftly overturn the conventional wisdom that creatures associated with light are benign and friendly. While lurkers in light are fey and have ties to the First World, these creatures are often found elsewhere in the Great Beyond. They are particularly fond of invading the Shadow Plane to bring light to those who dwell there-not to help, but to spread misery and pain among those to whom light is agonizing.",,5
Lusca,"A lusca is a predatory sea monster that resembles a three-headed shark with the body of an octopus. Ferocious electrical storms usually herald a lusca's arrival; such violent bursts of electricity result from the creature's superconductive flesh, which allows the lusca to store energy from lightning strikes that it can then discharge at foes.",,17
Lyrakien,"Lyrakiens are musical messengers and embodiments of free travel. They serve Desna and other deities and empyreal lords of Elysium, but are quite fond of the concept of free time and are always on the hunt for opportunities to pause in their duties to enjoy music or appreciate a moment of beauty. They love contests, stories, and songs, and they often challenge mortals to musical contests or pester them to share grand tales of their exploits. Lyrakiens rely on their agility to avoid conflicts, but they do their best to defend places of great natural beauty, especially against lawful or evil foes they can damage with their starlight. Lyrakiens have an innate wanderlust and rarely stay in the same place for very long. Some travel alongside adventurers, ofter writing songs about their quests and feats of derring-do.Though light-hearted creatures, lyrakiens don't let their whimsical personalities get in the way of protecting breathtaking natural locations. Often called “glistenwings” by gnomes and halflings, they are frequently mistaken for sprites or similar fey, a bit of confusion that many lyrakiens find amusing and fertile ground for shenanigans involving those they deem deserving of a bit of unexpected fun and discord in their lives.",Azata,1
Maftet Guardian,"Maftets are hawk-winged humanoids with leonine lower bodies that dwell in ancient ruins and cities thought lost, typically in desert or mountain regions. They view themselves as guardians and practice a specialized technique of dual-wielding scimitars so central to their culture that a maftet's scimitars are often cherished family heirlooms. Most maftets venerate their ancestors in addition to various deities, and even a child can detail their family lineage back multiple generations. Maftet prides tend to be matriarchal and isolationist, though maftets aren't necessarily hostile to outsiders who respect their homes and don't seek to loot them. When a young maftet comes of age, they receive runic tattoos from a pride's elder. These tattoos are imbued with magic that allows a maftet to enchant their wielded weapons, but the individualized designs tell of the maftet's ancestors, childhood adventures, and positive qualities. Such tattoos are considered sacred and never given to non-maftets.",Maftet,6
Mage for Hire,"Not all mercenaries sell brawn and intimidating glares. Some sell their magical talents to earn a living. While there are many types of mages for hire, some of the sneakiest are specialized in divination, using their skills for infiltration and sabotage.",Mercenaries,3
Mage of Many Styles,"The mage of many styles combines magical and martial tactics. They try to hamper foes with black tentacles or confusion, switching to damaging spells like lightning bolt once their opponents are properly lined up. When engaged in melee, they make liberal use of shocking grasp and true strike to deal powerful blows.",,13
Magma Scorpion,"Whether skittering through Abyssal wastelands or basking in the searing sand of the deepest deserts, magma scorpions have charred carapaces constantly emitting vision-warping waves of heat.","Elemental, Fire",8
Maharaja,"The most powerful of all rakshasas, maharajas form very rarely, never more than once or twice a century, and only from the reincarnated spirits of other powerful and wicked rakshasas. The birth of a new maharaja rakshasa is a momentous occasion, and less powerful rakshasas will seek to curry favor with the new maharaja at an early age. Each maharaja rakshasa is unique and boasts their own selection of spells. All are generally humanoid save for their many heads, which always number at least four and can range up to a dozen. One of these heads tends to be humanoid, while the others take the forms of cats, snakes, and other predatory animals.",Rakshasa,20
Mammoth,"Found mostly in colder climates, mammoths are accustomed to dealing with desperate and dangerous predators, trampling and crushing their enemies while using their larger tusks to greater effect. Humanoids dwelling in harsh, frost-bound lands rely on the mammoth’s strength to help them survive.",Elephant,10
Manananggal,"Manananggals are wicked monsters that live as humanoids during the day but feed upon them at night. To hide their depravities, these beings disguise themselves as everyday people—typically recluses or eccentrics— and use their proximity to a community to pick out their next targets before striking under cover of night. Manananggals use their long, hollow tongues to drain victims' blood from vital organs such as the liver, and the resulting odd drainage marks make it difficult to determine the exact nature of a victim's death. This typically leads to confusion, terror, and mistrust among communities, which most manananggals savor. While they fly, manananggals make a distinctive ticking sound, leading some to refer to the creatures as “tik-tiks,” and badly affected communities descend into fearful chaos at the first reports of this telltale noise. Manananggals share their cannibalistic, body-separating traits with other types of tanngals, such as penanggalans, though a number of characteristics set them apart. For instance, whereas penanggalans relish vinegar and even bathe in the substance, manananggals abhor the merest scent of it.",,8
Mandragora,"A mandragora looks like a freshly pulled tuber that has grown into the malformed shape of a child with a grotesque face and hideously bloated body. These insidious little plants typically form when a mandrake root is watered with a demon's blood. Upon absorbing the otherworldly properties of the demon's blood, the root animates and is forced to seek out blood to feast from, lest it die of thirst. Always famished and in search for sustenance, mandragoras live haunted, pained lives and perform vile and desperate acts to acquire the blood they crave. While they prefer magically infused blood such as that of unicorns, fey, or sorcerers, and they can also feed off of potions, alchemical bombs, and other magical elixirs, a mandragora can subsist on the blood of non-magical creatures. They find the flavor of mundane blood to be bland and bitter, and they do not blanch at voicing these complaints to the creatures from which they drink. While the typical mandragora is the size of a human child, some of these evil plants continue to grow and grow, reaching sizes more comparable to those of giants. Sometimes as they grow, they form additional limbs or rudimentary faces, eventually transforming into truly hideous mockeries of the human form.",,4
Manta Ray,"While manta rays might appear daunting, they are generally docile. Manta rays are found in temperate or tropical oceans, and they generally stay in the upper reaches or at the surface of deeper waters. These rays are filter feeders that subsist on plankton. They can also eat larger fish or aquatic creatures as the need arises, but rarely attack anything Small or larger. Many underwater cultures, particularly aquatic elves, raise and farm manta rays to serve as messengers, beasts of burden, or even pets. Manta rays don't make particularly good mounts, but some aquatic civilizations use them to draw underwater carriages.",Ray,1
Manticore,"The manticore is a monstrous amalgamation of lion, dragon, and human with a penchant for feasting on human flesh. Its distinctive tail is festooned with large quills like those of a porcupine, which the manticore flings at prey by whipping its tail like a sling. These deadly spikes give the manticore the power to slaughter even well-armed warriors from the safety of the sky. Although the anthropomorphic face of the manticore suggests a keen intellect, most creatures of its kind are simple-minded killers. They can be clever liars, however, and their voices have a strangely musical sound that has lured many unwitting travelers into an ambush. A manticore discovered by uneducated humanoids (especially those who are both lawful and evil) can sometimes become the center of adoration and even worship; a manticore in this situation swiftly gives in to its laziness and allows its acolytes to bring it tribute in the form of food and treasure, feasting upon its own followers when offerings become scarce. Stronger humanoids who encounter a manticore can cow it through intimidation and violence, sometimes even forcing it into service as a mount. As long as the manticore is well fed with human flesh and its master leads it to victory, a manticore mount can prove surprisingly loyal.",,6
Manticore Paaridar,"Monks dissatisfied with the limits of their humanoid forms and yearning for a shortcut can steal the might from other creatures. These monks become paaridars, amalgamations that blend the features of their former ancestry with the form of another creature. The transformation challenges the limits of the paaridar's body and soul, demanding continual discipline to maintain control. The rituals to make this transformation were developed by Paaridus, namesake of this loose monastic order. The process requires a captive creature—a victim to draw powers from. Over days of intense rituals, the monk displaces their own chakras with those of the victim. This unnatural process transforms the ki, and thereby the body. The lower chakras are considered “safer” to replace. Most Paaridars stop at the root, sacral, and navel chakras. To go farther risks losing control of one's emotions and intellect entirely, a fate Paaridus himself succumbed to. Paaridars consider this his sacrifice and lesson, but other monks recognize that even one step on this path is profane. The creature victimized by the ritual remains—still alive, but only a husk, as the transformed chakras within leave it weak and removed from its nature.",Paaridar,7
Marid,"Marids are capricious but powerful genies from the Plane of Water; among geniekind, they are rivaled in power only by the fiery efreet. Marids embody the strength of the ocean’s waves and currents, but they also have a gentler side, loving performance and art such as dancing, music, and storytelling.Marids regard efreet with hostility but rarely encounter them in their native environment. They get along with djinn, jann, and shaitans, although the latter consider marids flighty and annoying, associating only long enough to close trade deals. Marid society has strict rules of hospitality, and many marid cities have a magically sealed foreign quarter where marid shahzadas conduct business with air-breathers.",Genie,9
Marilith,"Mariliths are the generals of the Abyss, formed from the souls of proud evil mortals, often warlords and despots. They appear as tall and powerfully built humans from the waist up with snake tails and six arms. Because of Lamashtu’s prominence over other demonic deities, most pride demons encountered by mortals take female form, but they can be of any gender. Mariliths are among the greatest tacticians in the Abyss, and they have an almost supernatural knack for understanding the ripples of chaos and the unpredictable nature of demonic life. Their ability to command armies rises as much from their commanding presence as it does their ability to read into the potential results of any possible act and a sufficient understanding of the flow of entropy to allow them to predict likely outcomes.",Demon,17
Marrmora,"On the First World, marrmoras dwell in ruined wildlands perpetually scourged by fire and rarely, if ever, travel elsewhere. When a wildfire devastates a wilderness region on the Material Plane and results in the death of other fey, marrmoras can be drawn across the planar boundary to revel in the resulting destruction. They seek to reignite the fires that beckoned them, to gather up and feed upon the charred remains of those who perished within (particularly the bodies of dead fey), though they do grow homesick if they spend too much time away from the First World. They are burdened by a capricious but persistent rage and are unfailingly cruel. While they are capable of negotiation and intelligent interaction, they almost never bargain in good faith and typically interact with others only as a means to more efficiently spread their fiery devastation. A marmorra's twisted appearance evokes the look of an arboreal whose bark has been burnt down to charcoal. They have nearly featureless faces and hands ending in long, sharp claws. Their broken flesh looks like charcoal-burnt wood, riddled with cracks that still glow with an unwholesome heat. They trail ash wherever they walk, and wisps of smoke curl off of their bodies. Though marrmoras enjoy the sight of any woodland and its inhabitants roasting in the flames of their carefully curated fires, there is little that brings more pleasure to a marrmora than the sight of good-aligned plant creatures cooking to a crisp.",,15
Marsh Giant,"Dwellers of brackish coastal salt marshes and fetid bogs and swamps, marsh giants are hideous in appearance indeed, with fishlike mouths, slimy gray-green skin, and dark, beady eyes. They prefer to eat the flesh of those they slay in battle, but many are also cannibals. It is perhaps this vicious behavior that keeps the creatures in check, for if a fellow marsh giant becomes too dangerous and powerful, it runs the risk of being ambushed and consumed by its clan. Marsh giants are insular and mysterious, dedicating much of their lives to zealous worship of sea-dwelling deities or stranger entities. While there is no central religion followed by all marsh giants, many are known to venerate the demon lord Dagon, while others worship even more powerful monstrosities from the Elder Mythos, such as distant, dreaming Cthulhu. Only rarely do more than a dozen marsh giants settle together in a location, but when they do it is often for a religious purpose. Whatever call from the deep draws them together also tugs at nearby creatures such as boggards or skum, who look upon marsh giants in fear and reverence. The grim, terrifying chants and screams coming from such an encampment are a sure sign of terror to come for any other residents of the area. Barely topping 11 feet tall and 1,000 pounds, marsh giants are small for giants but make up for their relatively diminutive stature with their zealotry.",Giant,8
Marut,"A marut is tasked with hunting mortals who cheat death by artificially extending their lifespans. This includes those who seek undeath, such as liches and vampires, but also includes those who use powerful magic to cling to their youth, use divination to discover and avoid an appointed death, or call too often on the power of resurrection. Once the marut has selected its target, the inevitable pursues its quarry without surcease or deviation until either it or the target is dead. Maruts seem to be carved from stone and clad in golden armor, yet they move with the deliberate grace of a creature made of flesh and bone. A marut never rushes, but its thunderous footfalls are relentless as it pursues its target. Though able to speak any language, the marut is taciturn even among inevitables.",Aeon,15
Mastermind,"Masterminds weave long-ranged plots to see their nefarious goals come to fruition, deftly manipulating those around them, and turning enemies into friends and then pitting them against one another. When competing in a social or intellectual arena, the mastermind is a 7th-level challenge.",Villains,4
Mastodon,"Not to be confused with the larger mammoth, mastodons are primeval elephants who dwell predominantly in temperate forests. There, they travel in close-knit social groups and feed on the forest vegetation.",Elephant,9
Mechanical Carny,"Mechanical carnies are constructs manufactured to serve as entertainers, cleaners, and guards at carnivals and circuses. The first of these constructs was created by a gnome inventor who yearned for a tireless companion who could make her laugh and smile. Her invention was so successful that it has spawned countless imitations and knockoffs throughout the Inner Sea, and mechanical carnies of some form or another are a staple throughout metropolitan lands in both Avistan and Garund. Other Mechanical Carnies The statistics here represent a relatively simple mechanical carny; the extravagance and range of a mechanical carny’s abilities are limited only by the skill and imagination of its creator. To represent other kinds of mechanical carnies, you can swap out the mechanical carny’s Berserk and Berserk Slam abilities with one of the following. Bounce Back  [reaction]  Requirement The mechanical carny takes damage from a melee attack; Effect The mechanical carny wobbles violently to and fro, making two headbutt Strikes: the first against the creature (if any) on the opposite side of itself from the creature that triggered this reaction and the second against the creature that triggered this reaction. Spring-Loaded Jump  [one-action]  (move) The mechanical carny leaps up to 25 feet into the air and lands within 25 feet (or a distance equal to the height of the carny’s jump, if fewer) of where it started, taking no falling damage. Water Cannon  [two-actions]  (water) The mechanical carny sprays a 15-foot cone of water, dealing 2d6+4 nonlethal bludgeoning to creatures in the area (DC 18 basic Reflex save) and extinguishing any non-magical fires.",,2
Medusa,"Monstrous humanoids that resemble humans with snakes instead of hair, medusas are best known for their petrifying gazes that—if lingered upon—can permanently transform mortals to stone. Medusas are shrewd and manipulative adversaries who collect and covet secrets, and who use threats and guile to exploit the fears of weaker creatures. A medusa may seek out powerful magic items, use divination magic to discover secret knowledge and unlock forbidden power, or infiltrate a society to beguile influential politicians. Their ability to worm their way into powerful organizations makes them natural leaders of criminal outfits and thieves’ guilds, and their interest in magical phenomena leads some to pursue careers as oracles who offer to help adventurers find what they seek—for a price. Of course, if wit and deception proves insufficient, a medusa can always simply turn rivals into ornate stone decorations with little more than a glare. Exceptionally agile and surprisingly hardy, a medusa rarely backs down from a conflict even when cornered. Many adventurers who thought themselves readied to resist the effects of a medusa’s gaze have nevertheless fallen to a medusa, as these creatures are also often deadly archers able to riddle their foes with venom-coated arrows from a distance. Still, a medusa may barter for their life if no alternatives remain, and the secrets carried by these powerful villains often make it more than worth sparing the monster’s life.",,7
Megalania,"Megalanias, like their smaller cousins the giant monitor lizards, strike fast and use their powerful bite to grip their prey. They prefer to swallow their prey whole rather than risk others getting a bite of a hard-won meal.",Lizard,7
Megalictis,"These giant weasels are driven by the same hunger that plagues their smaller cousins, but because of their much larger size, they can quickly devastate the wildlife in an environment. They tend to avoid humanoids but have been known to attack if driven by hunger or fear.  A megalictis uses the same constricting bite as smaller weasels, remaining attached even if other creatures attack. Given their remarkable stature, a megalictis can take down sizable prey, including horses and even the occasional bear, if the opportunity presents itself. A megalictis can grow to be 5 feet long and weighs around 150 pounds.",Weasel,3
Megaloceros,"Similar in form to the elk but far superior in size is the megaloceros. The average male is a towering creature with antlers that alone weigh nearly 100 pounds. These antlers are enormous and can be wider than their bodies are long. Megaloceroses stand up to 9 feet tall, weighing 1,500 pounds and with antlers growing over 12 feet wide.",Elk,4
Megalodon,"Prehistoric sharks of incredible size, strength, and ferocity, megalodons scour waters deep and shallow to sate their considerable hunger. The presence of a megalodon undeniably affects the local aquatic ecosystem.",Shark,9

Megatherium,"Megatheriums dwell deep within ancient forests and humid jungles. Fiercely territorial, these immense creatures are often smelt before seen. Though they travel on all fours, megatheriums can reach foliage 20 feet above the forest floor by standing on their hind legs and short, thick tails. Their enormous foreclaws, used to bend tree limbs within reach of their mouths, can cleave a horse in two and crush its rider. The musk of the megatherium serves as a warning to potential predators and other megatheriums that they're too close. Adult megatheriums are so territorial that most don't reproduce more than twice in their lifetime. Though the creatures regularly patrol their territory for intruders, they tend to avoid settlements unless food has become scarce. When they do stray into towns, they've been known to devour entire orchards in a day.",Sloth,5
Meladaemon,"Meladaemons personify death by starvation and thirst, and revel in spreading the same despair that brought about their mortal demise. When they aren't blighting fields, massacring livestock, or tainting water supplies, they experiment on prisoners to study how long creatures can go without sustenance and the deleterious effects that result from such deprivation. Fiercely loyal to Trelmarixian, Horseman of Famine, they serve no other beings. They work alongside other daemons if Trelmarixian wills it, but are notoriously traitorous.",Daemon,11
Melixie,"Melixies are hyperactive insect sprites with legendary sweet tooths, capable of drinking down honey, nectar, sugar, and other sweets in alarming quantities. Melixies take the insectile wings common among winged fey and up the ante with antennae and additional insect features, typically shared with bees but sometimes with butterflies, moths, ladybugs, or other beetles. Melixies live in a pattern of rapid consumption of sweets, incredible productivity in tasks of all sorts, and then a crash to sleep it all off and start again. Melixies in their productive state even engage happily in large-scale repetitive tasks that most sprites find dreadfully dull. In their spare time, melixies love to dance, and some of them learn a dancelike sign language called Melisylvan, allowing them to communicate a full range of information through movement. ",Sprite,0
Melody On The Wind,"This cloud of song and sound has been caught by the wind and carried across the air. While the melody on the wind (known by some as a song elemental, despite the fact that no such place as a plane of song exists in the known multiverse) might enjoy the beauty of music, it is by nature a destructive elemental force.","Elemental, Air",10
Melomach,"Melomachs are massive, vaguely humanoid elementals composed of metal debris. They take great pride in decorating and augmenting their metallic bodies with haphazardly placed spikes, blades, humanoid or bestial skulls, and other similar adornments, the more ostentatious the better. When two melomachs meet, the resulting contests of physical might and vocal prowess can last for days, often leaving the landscape ravaged for miles in every direction.","Elemental, Metal",13
Merchant,"Small settlements can typically support one or two generalist merchants, and larger cities house multiple specialists—experts in one type of product. Merchants can be found anywhere: vendors hustling in the public square, shopkeepers running small storefronts, traveling salespeople in carriages or caravans, or wealthy tycoons running entire organizations devoted to commerce. For encounters involving negotiation or mercantile skill, a merchant is a 4th—level challenge. A merchant might have an additional Lore skill about a specific category of item (such as jewelry or magic weapons), with a total skill bonus 2 higher than Mercantile Lore.",Tradespeople,-1
Mercurial,"Some of the most populous denizens of the Plane of Metal, mercurials are weird creatures of liquid metal known for changing their features, chemical compositions, and temperaments with equal frequency. Excitable, curious, and friendly, mercurials are quick to offer assistance to extraplanar beings, but their volatile personalities can make them unreliable allies.","Elemental, Metal",2

Metal Scamp,"The capricious and destructive metal scamps are self-appointed forces of entropy, taking great pleasure in indiscriminately wrecking everything around them, sometimes even to their own detriment. Metal scamps have a severe appearance, with pointed facial features and angular limbs, and their skin can be the color of any metal, often heavily oxidized as if by years of exposure to the elements.","Elemental, Mephit",1
Metal Wisp,"A metal wisp is a roiling sphere of rust particles and sharp metal fragments, all furiously orbiting a liquid metal core that resembles the skull of a mortal creature—usually a humanoid, but animal and even more fantastical skulls are not uncommon. They don't form attachments as easily as wisps from other elemental planes, which tend to view metal wisps as too morose, although they retain a certain curiosity since their return from the planar severance.","Elemental, Wisp",0
Mezlan,"The bizarre shapeshifters known as mezlans were created ages ago as spies and infiltrators by a long-forgotten ritual infusing a magically constructed ooze with the soul of an exceptional sapient being. Having long since outlasted their creators, mezlans most often dwell alone amongst the ruins of the ancient civilizations they served as mortals.",,14
Mi-Go,"Mi-gos are both scientists and colonists, yet their extraterrestrial nature and malevolent motives color their investigations with cruelty. While their shape resembles that of an arthropod, mi-gos are in fact a highly evolved and intelligent fungus. In mi-go society, the pursuit of secular knowledge and religious epiphany have no distinction and inspire their pursuits in tandem. They view the Outer Gods and Great Old Ones of the Elder Mythos less as gods to obey and more as muses or figures of inspiration. This results in their use of a strange blend of magic and technology to create bizarre, organic items that are grown and spliced together as much as crafted in the traditional sense. A mi-go can survive in the void of outer space and flies through the vacuum at incredible speeds—though these journeys can take months within a single solar system and years to travel beyond. When they come to new planets to mine resources rare on their home worlds, they use clever disguises that mix technology and magic to appear as creatures of that world. While there, they select the greatest minds of that world as trophies, extracting their brains and preserving them within an eldritch cylinder that grants an awful immortality to the mind kept within.",,6
Millindemalion,"Millindemalion are cruel fey tricksters capable of causing mayhem with their magical, mind-altering hats. Many folk tales from around the world speak of industrious fey who help struggling crafters—cobblers, milliners, tailors, and so on—during the night, creating quality wares in secret for no payment greater than a crumb of bread or a saucer of cream. These stories hold a grain of truth, as gracious fey do occasionally journey from the First World to aid a humble artisan on a whim, for bribes of food, or sometimes even as part of a concerted effort to spread beauty throughout the world. However, when an artisan becomes too reliant on this help, their friendly fey helper might become warped and twisted with resentment and neglect. Eventually, they could transform into a cruel prankster who delights in punishing mortals who dare task a fey with such mundane work. The millindemalion is the result of a kindly, hat-making fey undergoing such a transformation. Some scholars believe this erratic behavior is caused by the preponderance of quicksilver used in most millinery.",,13
Mimic,"Thought to be the result of a failed experiment meant to animate objects or a sinister alghollthu creation, mimics are clever monsters that can take the form of common manufactured objects. Mimics are ambush predators and voracious eaters, surprising their prey through their uncanny ability to mimic the form of common furniture and miscellany. They remain disguised until unsuspecting adventurers happen by, then they lash out in ambush. Mimics possess complex alien minds, and while often cruel and self-serving, they also enjoy conversation with their prey from time to time. For unknown reasons, they are especially interested in humanoids. Mimics have a strong dislike for others of their kind and tend to live alone. A mimic can remain in its alternate form for an extremely long period of time, sometimes remaining disguised in a dungeon chamber for decades. Regardless of how long it waits, the mimic remains vigilant and alert, ready to strike at any moment.",,4
Minchgorm,"An oddity even among the strange creatures of the First World of the fey, the aquatic minchgorm is a monstrous alien maw ringed with writhing tendrils. It interacts with the world through grasping, speaking simulacra that it magically shapes from water.",,18
Mindmoppet,"Mindmoppets are the result of laboratory experimentation that sought to harness telepathic energy within a liquid alchemical concoction. Mindmoppets feed on the latent telepathic energy of creatures. Even those with no apparent gift but with an active mind can sustain a mindmoppet for days. Such feeding is not invasive, and mindmoppets continually “graze” even while inactive. Mindmoppets are willing servants to anyone who concerns themselves with strenuous mental exercise. Their creator is usually an obvious first choice, and they serve them dutifully. However, they have only an academic understanding of good and evil, of ethics, or mortal limitations. They see service to their master's science as the ultimate standard by which they judge their actions or those of others. This can lead to conflict between them and their creator, especially if the master appears lax in their efforts to further their studies. To a mindmoppet, continuous learning is imperative. Mindmoppets appear to have some ability to see a short distance into the future, though this might only be that their innate interest for thought and cognition gives them a knack for anticipating the actions of others.",,5
Miner,"Miners explore deep underground in search of minerals and rare materials, taking numerous precautions to keep themselves safe.",Laborers,0
Minister Of Tumult,"Ministers of tumult are grandmasters of killing, having cultivated their prowess to supernatural levels through the qi reaved from countless mortals. Many such jiang-shi ministers rule over settlements or even entire city-states, cowing their subjects into unerring obedience. A settlement or city-state under the control of a minister of tumult typically seems, on the outside, like everything is running smoothly and with clockwork precision. Guard patrols, street cleanings, carriages, and more always arrive precisely at the designated time, neither early nor late. To a visitor who doesn't pay any heed to the unease behind the smiles on the inhabitants' faces, the minister of tumult's fiefdom might appear to be a marvelous place to live. But the truth is much more dire. Ministers of tumult keep control and engorge themselves with qi by draining qi from criminals. If the minister of tumult is hungry and there haven't been any serious crimes, they simply dole out this punishment for petty crimes, minor infractions, or simple failures to perform adequately. This keeps the people in check, as there always seems to be a way to avoid the penalty by acting perfectly.","Vampire, Jiang-Shi",14
Minotaur,"Minotaurs are master hunters that dwell in cunning labyrinths or tangles of underground caverns meant to disorient and demoralize prey. These monstrous tormentors delight in the hunt, in the terror caused by closing in on prey, and in the very moment when the hunted realizes that they have lost the game. Only then will the minotaur charge in for the kill, cutting foes down with powerful strikes or impaling them on its sharp horns. Minotaurs are known to dwell in mazes, but they can also be found hiding in old ruins and other forgotten corners of the world. In any case, they are solitary creatures, only rarely sharing territory with others of their kind or even more powerful beings that have cowed them into service. Everyone else is little more than prey to be hunted.",,4
Misery Siktempora,"Creatures born of intense pain and suffering, the armless, six-legged misery siktemporas are some of the most numerous of their kind since misery is as ubiquitous an experience as living. They're also the most proactive of siktemporas, seeking to propagate the misery from which they spawn. They delight in opportunities to travel to the Material Plane, where misery is so woefully prevalent and easily multiplied.",Siktempora,12
Mist Stalker,"The tentacled mist stalker shrouds itself in a cloak of mist through which its single, never-blinking eye can see with clarity, allowing it an advantage when stalking its prey.","Elemental, Water",4
Mitflit,"Mitflits, also known as mites, are self-loathing and pitiful cowards, easily bullied into servitude by other creatures or even slightly more powerful mitflit leaders. They tame insects, spiders, and other such creatures to serve as faithful allies. Mitflits have lost most of their ancestral gremlin magic, leaving these incomplete beings full of doubt and insecurity. Mitflits find companionship in the other base creatures of the world, and forge bonds of friendship with vermin, the only other beings that seem willing to accept them. A social structure, even one in which they are bullied, partially fills the hole within mitflits’ personalities, and they rarely rebel or rail out unless their rage hits a breaking point.",Gremlin,-1
Mithral Golem,"Mithral golems are gorgeously crafted, silvery humanoids made from colossal amounts of the purest mithral. While massive in construction, they possess amazing speed and grace through literal fluidity. Unpredictable and flexible, they can melt into liquid form and reform into a solid shape in mere seconds, allowing them to shape their limbs into sharp spikes or heavy fists as needed.",Golem,16

Mobogo,"Mobogos are massive, swamp-dwelling monstrosities that combine the worst aspects of giant toads and evil dragons. Lazy, cruel, and greedy, these vile creatures make their lairs in the most ancient and primordial swamps. The boggards who call such places home worship mobogos as living demigods, regularly bringing sacrifices of food and valuables lest they become the next victims of the mobogos' boundless appetites.",,10
Mohrg,"The weight of murder wears heavy on the soul. With souls marked by a lifetime of dealing death, these killers, whether mass murderers, bloodthirsty soldiers, or sadistic executioners, sometimes do not let judgment and lawful execution stanch their slaying sprees. When such individuals are brought to justice, they may rise after death as mohrgs to continue their ruinous work. Drawn to others of their kind, mohrgs prefer to hunt in small groups, occasionally in partnership with weaker free-willed undead such as shadows and wights. They seek out weak prey and revel in causing drawn-out suffering. Some mohrgs haunt locations they favored in life, reenacting old crimes on new victims. They may even skulk about in public, wearing rags, cloaks, or freshly harvested skins to hide their nature. The most dangerous mohrgs are those who grow powerful enough to no longer fear being struck down again and openly assault settlements in an attempt to turn living towns into mass graves. Since those slain by a mohrg rise soon thereafter as mohrg spawn, the murders of a mohrg rarely go unnoticed for long, even when they take extra care to prey only on a society's dregs. Since mohrg spawn remain under a mohrg's control, a canny mohrg might order its spawn to remain in hiding to keep its presence secret until a point where it feels confident unleashing its undead army upon a doomed settlement. Mohrgs retain a twisted sentimentality for the crimes of their mortal life, seeking out trinkets that remind them of favorite murders. When not out hunting, mohrgs arrange their mementos into disturbing shrines. Often, these trinkets are valuable objects, and might even provide important clues to ongoing mysteries.Mohrg Spawn When a creature returns after death as a mohrg spawn, its flesh decays away save for its entrails, and it grows a long, awful tongue. The creature gains the undead trait and becomes chaotic evil, and it loses any abilities that come from it being a living creature. It gains darkvision, negative healing, and the mohrg's immunities and resistances. If the creature had hands, it gains a claw Strike (an unarmed attack that deals slashing damage). The creature also gains a tongue Strike, an agile attack that causes paralysis, as the mohrg ability; the Fortitude save uses the DC for the mohrg spawn's level. Mohrg spawn cannot create mohrg spawn of their own.",,8
Mokele-Mbembe,"Mokele-mbembes are large, reptilian predators found deep within Golarion's jungles. Mwangi view mokele-mbembes as embodiments of nature's strength and majesty, and they consider the sighting of this rare being a sign of favor from the gods and an omen of powerful natural forces. Mokele-mbembes are solitary and excel at going undetected. Most information about them—including the fact that they're voracious predators—comes from following the signs of their passage.",,9
Monadic Deva,"Monadic devas stand vigil along the River of Souls as it passes from the mortal realm into the Ethereal Plane. Those who seek to fish souls out for their own use stalk this metaphysical river, and it is against these predators that monadic devas fight. At other times, monadic devas work to guide newcomers to the River of Souls who might be in danger of drifting from the current and lingering as ghosts. Monadic devas often find their tasks place them in alliances with psychopomps, and they work well with the monitors despite the philosophical divide between their views on a soul's inherent goodness. A monadic deva is 7 feet tall and weighs 220 pounds.",Angel,12

Moon Hag,"Moon hags are powerful soothsayers who dwell in places where souls receive their final judgment. These vile creatures possess knowledge of—and perhaps some power over—the portals between the lands of the living and the dead, and innocent mortals sometimes seek them out for this reason. Moon hags use their knowledge to sow discord and place seeds of doubt in those who unwittingly seek their aid. Beings of great power can intimidate them into sharing the truth of what they know, but the cunning hags always try to hide some important piece of information or word things in such a way that anyone acting on their divinations still find their plans falling into ruin.",Hag,10
Moonflower,"These enormous plants have thick, knotted trunks festooned with fanged blossoms. A gaping mouth sits at the top of the trunk, capable of swallowing most creatures smaller than the moonflower whole. Moonflowers can move slowly on their powerful roots or use them to attack, but usually they dig them deeply into the surrounding ground and remain stationary to await prey. Though moonflowers can't speak in the conventional sense, they communicate telepathically with other moonflowers. Explorers who encounter a single moonflower can thus be assured that any other moonflowers in the vicinity will be prepared for them. Those who manage to intercept a moonflower's telepathic communications are assaulted by visions of dreadful, primeval jungles ruled over by titanic plant life. Whether this is some vision of the past or a dream of the future shared by all moonflowers is unknown. Moonflowers are alien life-forms from a long-dead planet, but their proliferation throughout the galaxy has been ensured through the machinations of the Dominion of the Black, a sinister, alien organization from the dark places between the stars.",,8
Moose,"Moose are a large, solitary type of deer. They're majestic, territorial, and extremely grumpy—traits that make them dangerous to unwary travelers and would-be predators alike. Males are instantly recognizable, standing 7 feet tall at the shoulder, with large heads and thick necks to support their impressive palmate antlers. They shed their antlers come winter and grow a new set each year at a rapid rate. For most of the year, moose roam tundra, forest, and wilderness territories by themselves. Their hooves are wide, allowing them to more easily traverse the frequent snowfall of their native terrain, and they typically journey alone. Moose come together only during mating season, a time in which they become oddly social with one another, loud, and even more aggressive to other creatures than usual. A moose's diet consists of leaves, woody plant matter like twigs or bark, and buds of trees and shrubs. Moose are so large they prefer to eat the leaves of trees taller than humans instead of lowering their giant heads all the way to the ground. This can make them easy to track, though hunters will find actually killing a moose is a far greater challenge than finding it. Despite their size, moose have many natural predators, especially pack animals like wolves and large carnivores like tigers. Large humanoids like ogres and trolls dwelling in the wilderness sometimes make sport of chasing down and wrestling moose. Despite their large size, moose are expert swimmers in both fresh and salt water, and they readily feed on aquatic vegetation. Moose rarely swim into open seas, however, and usually stay close to land, though ocean predators have been known to hunt swimming moose. To an observer watching from the safe distance of a dry shore, the large branching antlers of a swimming moose can sometimes be mistaken for a tree bobbing along in the water.",,3
Morlock,"Originating from humans long lost from the world of light, morlocks are brutal monsters that dwell in the tangled tunnels of the upper reaches of the Darklands. Their wiry frames mask the strength of their limbs and their swift reactions, and their arms are long enough that they can drop into an uncanny, four-limbed shuffle for speed or stealth. They no longer remember the lives their ancestors led on the surface, although many morlocks still dwell in the shattered ruins of their ancient homes. Some morlocks worship the statues of humans from these bygone eras as gods, but others now worship Lamashtu, Rovagug, or other violent deities. Morlock young are insatiable and clamor for even the slightest morsel of food, even consuming their siblings if no other meal presents itself. Most morlocks encourage the practice to ensure their ancestral group as a whole grows stronger. A typical morlock stands just over 5 feet tall and weighs roughly 150 pounds.",Morlock,2

Mothman,"Little is known of the strange creatures known as mothmen, save that when they make themselves known, calamity is sure to follow. The mothman sees themself as an agent of fate—provided such fate is devastating and destructive. Often, those who encounter a mothman never recall the meeting, yet live on to unknowingly pursue and enable the creature's obscure plans. The name “mothmen” is, of course, not these creatures' own name for themselves, but an appellation granted by the fearful who glimpse them and tell harrowing tales of their sightings. They each keep their own names, or a collection for use in different situations, yet have no need for a collective word for their kind.",,7
Movanic Deva,"Movanic devas are stewards of the flow of good creatures' souls through the cycle of life and death, from the point a creature is born to the day it dies. These angels arise from the souls of stalwart nurturers and protectors, and share a specific connection with a creature's vital essence—its life force. Movanic devas are most concerned with guiding and protecting good creatures during their mortal lives, so once a soul has passed into the River of Souls, the movanic deva leaves its protection to the soul angels, or monadic devas. As part of their stewardship over good creatures, movanic devas can waken within animals a level of sapience to allow them to become kindly and benevolent as well, thus increasing the flow of goodness into the afterlife. They also spend time patrolling the Positive Energy Plane and Negative Energy Plane, seeking to contain significant threats to life.",Angel,10
Mpeshi,"In the heights of the world, where the hills and mountains reach up to touch the clouds, mpeshis fall to the earth in flashes of lightning and thunder. Most return to the heavens on the gossamer strands of web on which they descend, but those few that remain cry out, lamenting their inability to return to their homes in the sky. A mpeshi appears to be a monstrous goat with the foreclaws, hindquarters, and tail of a crocodile. Electricity arcs around its sharp horns, which it can use to both batter and gore with equal facility. Although mpeshis are always seeking methods to return to their homes in the clouds, they aggressively defend their earthbound lairs from outsiders. Mpeshis are generally solitary, though some congregate as pairs or small groups that watch cloud movements together. They can sometimes be seen trying to join reach the storm clouds, leaping from high places such as hills, mountains, or cliffs. Though these attempts are rarely successful, the mpeshis always resolve to try again—and some do manage succeed at returning to their mysterious homes amongst the clouds. Mpeshis are utterly unafraid of roc, dragons, or other monstrous flying creatures, usually seeing them as competition. Mpeshis are crafty, though, and sometimes try to negotiate transportation back to the clouds from flying creatures larger than they are.",,6
Mu Spore,"A mu spore is a thankfully rare fungoid monstrosity of vast power and strange intellect. Even the smallest mu spores are never less than a hundred feet long from tentacle tip to tentacle tip, yet despite this vast bulk, they are capable of flying with an uncommon grace, venting jets of foul-smelling spores to guide their flight. Many societies tell tales of vast mu spores appearing over cities at the dawn of apocalyptic events, but they’re more than just ravenous eaters of nations. Mu spores often possess rare or esoteric knowledge, and if peaceful contact can be made, this lore can be quite valuable. Their spores can also be used to craft certain foul drugs or deadly alchemical poisons, but harvesting these ingredients is dangerous, as the spores are not viable for long once they’ve been shed, forcing alchemists seeking to harvest them to operate in perilously close proximity to the abominations.",,21
Muckish Creep,"Legends say that the first muckish creeps were born at the site of a mass grave where the souls of murdered prisoners coalesced into the surrounding soil. Another myth tells that muckish creeps were elementals so vile that their kin banished them from the Plane of Earth. Regardless of their true origins, muckish creeps are wicked creatures that resemble mud given a humanoid shape. The mud is no ordinary mixture of earth and water, however, for muckish creeps feed on the blood of the living, and they use this blood to keep their own forms moist and malleable. Muckish creeps are particularly tenacious and single-minded when it comes to choosing prey. Once a muckish creep selects its next victim, there is little one can do to stop it, since it can seep through even the smallest cracks between doors, walls, and windows. A muckish creep typically waits until its target falls asleep before pressing itself into the creature's home, intent to kill. For all its tenacity during the hunt, the muckish creep is pragmatic when it comes to the actual kill, using its body to fill the victim's airways with mud and suffocate them.",,8
Mudwretch,"In its resting form, a mudwretch looks like a large puddle of thick, dark mud, heaped at the center in a slightly drier patch of loam. When a living creature approaches, though, the mudwretch lurches upward, piling its muddy flesh upon itself to form a roughly humanoid shape, often in vague mockery of the approaching creature's general form in cases where the creature is a humanoid itself. Mudwretches possess a low level of intellect, and while they do not form societies or cultures of their own, they are attracted to ruins or abandoned settlements. They have little need to eat, but without a constant source of moisture, a mudwretch dries out, suffering from low throbbing aches until it can resaturate. Often, blood from living creatures has to do—a dried mudwretch is more dangerous to intruders than one that's comfortably wallowing on a river bank.",,2
Mukradi,"Fearsome centipede-like creatures, mukradis are three-headed predators with a devastating array of breath weapons. A Darklands version of the mukradi is rumored to exist. It’s said these variant mukradis have black scales, and all of their heads spew a black, acidic goo that animates before being reabsorbed by the mukradis.",,15
Mulventok,"Sinister fleshwarpers reshape captive urdefhans into these juggernauts of war. Their clear skin is hardened into a thick, mirror-like carapace, creating an intimidating exoskeleton. Mulventoks don't live long; within weeks—or, at most, months—their hyperdeveloped muscles split open their toughened skin, and they erupt in a shower of gore. A mulventok's creator shapes its mind just as much as its body, directing its aggression toward a single purpose, such as to raze a fortress or murder a specific individual.",Fleshwarp,7
Mummified Cat,"Some of the wealthy have their favored pets mummified or wish to use the animal's fractured memories but strong instincts and natural weapons to turn them into formidable tomb guardians. No other animal was so trusted in the afterlife as felines, who were almost without exception buried alongside deceased pharaohs. Though small in stature, a clowder of mummified cats has ended the life of many a would-be tomb robber.",Mummy,0
Mummy Guardian,"The majority of mummies were created by cruel and selfish masters to serve as guardians to protect their tombs from intruders. The traditional method of creating a mummy guardian is a laborious and sadistic process that begins well before the poor soul to be transformed is dead, during which the victim is ritualistically starved of nourishing food and instead fed strange spices, preservative agents, and toxins intended to quicken the desiccation of the flesh. The victim remains immobile but painfully aware during the final stages, where its now-useless entrails are extracted before it’s shrouded in funerary wrappings and entombed within a necromantically ensorcelled sarcophagus to await intrusions in the potentially distant future. While it’s certainly possible to use other methods to create a mummy guardian from an already-deceased body, those who seek to create these foul undead as their guardians in the afterlife often feel that such methods result in inferior undead—the pain and agony of death by mummification being an essential step in the process. Regardless of the method of their creation, mummy guardians are more than just physical shells of flesh and bone—they retain fragmented, distorted versions of their minds, with only enough memories of their living personality remaining to fuel their undead anger and jealousy of those who yet live. This burning rage only intensifies over the centuries of waiting within a crypt for the chance to actually act, and thus when most mummy guardians are awoken by tomb robbers or adventurers, they stop at nothing in pursuit of glorious slaughter.",Mummy,6
Mummy Pharaoh,"While mummy guardians are undead crafted from the corpses of sacrificed—usually unwilling victims—and retain only fragments of their memories, a mummy pharaoh is the result of a deliberate embrace of undeath by a sadistic and cruel ruler. The transformation from life to undeath is no less awful and painful, but as the transition is an intentional bid to escape death by a powerful personality who fully embraces the blasphemous repercussions of the choice, the mummy pharaoh retains its memories and personality intact. Although in most cases a mummy pharaoh is formed from a particularly depraved ruler instructing their priests to perform complex rituals that grant the ruler eternal unlife, a ruler who was filled with incredible anger in life might spontaneously arise from death as a mummy pharaoh without undergoing this ritual. Depending on the nature of the ruler, a mummy pharaoh might have spellcasting or other class features instead of its Attack of Opportunity and disruptive abilities—the exact nature of the abilities the ruler had in life can significantly change or strengthen the mummy pharaoh presented here (which represents the least powerful variety of this deadly undead foe).",Mummy,9
Mummy Prophet of Set,"In ancient Osirion, worshipers completely devoted to the evil god Set often underwent a mummification process to serve as his prophets after their death.",Mummy,13

Munavri Spellblade,"Although the subterranean Darklands are known for their cruel and domineering civilizations—led by fiend-worshipping drow, urdefhans, and others—that dwell within those sinister caverns, not every such subterranean society is ruled that way. Munavris are perhaps the best example of a people that tend to treat new arrivals to their Darklands territories with good temper, fairness, and respect.",Munavri,2

Murajau,"Murajaus, one of many nomadic creatures of the Plane of Water, appear humanoid from the waist up but resemble a large hermit crab from the waist down, including a pair of strong pincers. Murajau communities are often multilingual, and many individuals are willing to work as translators and guides to adventurers if properly compensated. Rather than currency, murajaus prefer to deal in trinkets such as talismans, particularly those that protect travelers. For murajaus, such items signify their sincerity and unwavering desire to protect others. They trade tales among each other of treasure troves too dangerous to easily explore. Rather than keep this information solely for themselves, they're happy to share it with trustworthy people they meet in exchange for a small share. Faydhaans tell condescending tales of murajaus, describing their origin as royal servants who failed to fulfill a royal decree. Murajaus' own creation story, meanwhile, claims that the royal decree in question requested they travel the lands to provide shelter and hospitality to visitors, a mission they have since carried on for generations. They take great pride in treating guests well, especially in providing suitable food, drink, and gifts.",,5
Muse Phantom,"For performers who die before their time and whose love of the theater is stronger than death’s grasp, the show does indeed go on. Such actors rise from the grave to become muse phantoms—undead spirits that haunt opera houses or auditoriums and possess the bodies of living actors to continue their art. A host is often utterly unaware of being possessed by a muse phantom. Like egotistical parasites, muse phantoms assume command of their unwitting thespian shells only during big shows with packed audiences, and even then the host might chalk up their sudden lack of control to the transcendence of performance, not the nefarious influence of some paranormal entity. In time, a performer’s mind can become utterly warped by the spirit’s domination, twisting artistic temperament and vanity into evil selfishness and tireless obsession.",,5

Myceloid,"The ambulatory fungus creatures called myceloids are notorious for spreading deadly purple pox, controlling creatures' minds, and devouring humanoid flesh. For a myceloid colony, any battle with humanoids is cause for excitement, as this new fodder presents so many delicious possibilities. Myceloids consider humanoids to have an ideal life cycle of four simple steps. During childhood, they wander naive and afraid, unaware of myceloid colonies. In adulthood, humanoids discover their true purpose as they taste purple pox and become enslaved by the myceloids' spores. Next, they die, giving rise to a new myceloid. They're then sent on to the afterlife upon becoming a myceloid meal. Eating humanoid flesh is not a necessity—a myceloid can survive on any decaying matter—but it's certainly a pleasure. Myceloids rarely make alliances, but when they do, they invite their new allies to share a meal to seal the pact. Few outsiders appreciate this hospitality. Most myceloids have deep purple caps studded with off-white lumps. Their necks and bodies bear resemblance to the stipes of tough, leathery fungi. Smaller mushrooms often grow on a myceloid's body, which the creatures view as either adornments or particularly convenient snacks. They stand roughly as tall as a dwarf, with comparably stout builds.",,4
Myroga,"Myrogas are avaricious, simple-minded dragons with supernatural occult powers. They draw their amazing abilities from ley lines—loci of intense magical energy often associated with psychic phenomena. A myroga encountered away from a ley line is far less dangerous, a fact which myrogas recognize and take great pains to mitigate. Upon discovering an unoccupied ley line, a myroga is apt to roost nearby and guard the site ferociously. All the while, it sups on the ley line's nearly inexhaustible ambient magic to grow stronger and expand its repertoire of brutal powers.",,6
Myrucarx,"The slithering, shapeless beings known as myrucarxes occasionally slip into the Material Plane from their domains deep in the Shadow Plane, seeking to torment those who love light. Myrucarxes weave powerful illusions to draw unsuspecting victims into their squirming embrace, and they favor large cities as hunting grounds. Rather than devastate a community, a myrucarx instead prefers to snatch only a few victims to engender fear and paranoia, then retreat somewhere dark to hibernate for months or years before renewing its terrors. A myrucarx resembles a monstrous, oily slug with tentacles ending in gnashing jaws, but most victims only ever see the illusory personas it projects to lure and torment its prey.",,18
Nabasu,"Nabasus are birthed directly into the Material Plane from the Abyss, an invasive infestation that releases the newly formed and ravenously hungry demons directly into the midst of their favored prey: mortal life. Nabasus feed on sapient creatures, but they never quite manage to sate their eternal hunger, even as they grow more and more powerful. Once they have sufficiently feasted, the demons become worthy to make the return trip to the Abyss, where they undergo a vile transformation, finally digesting their accumulated meals and deforming further into powerful vrolikais.Nabasus form from the souls of evil gluttons, particularly from cannibals, blood-drinkers, and those who prefer the tang of undead flesh.",Demon,8
Nagaji Soldier,"Nagaji are brawny bipeds with humanoid figures and serpentine heads. Their bodies are covered in tightly layered scales that range in color from green to brown, and almost all nagaji have a colorful ridge along their head and back. Ophidian eyes lend nagaji an imperious visage, with irises that span every color of the rainbow",Nagaji,2
Naiad,"Naiads protect streams, ponds, springs, and other natural bodies of fresh water. While most naiads lead solitary lives close to their chosen ward, sometimes these nymphs congregate in coven-like groups where river tributaries meet, performing great magic and blessing the waters of the land. Because naiads’ bonds to their bodies of water permit more flexibility, they are the nymphs most likely to interact with humanoids and even visit their settlements on occasion. Unlike other nymphs, naiads occasionally become adventurers, especially when dark forces seek to despoil nature or otherwise threaten the land, joining forces with others to prevent the corruption of nature.",Nymph,1
Naiad Queen,"Naiad queens rule over pristine wildernesses centered on untouched lakes or other bodies of fresh water. Bards’ songs and artists’ paintings of nymphs tend to depict naiad queens in their slightly more humanoid forms, which they don when they make the rare journey into civilized lands to garner allies or gauge threats. Most naiad queens treat those who respect their domains with kindness, but they are fierce and quick in eliminating foes. Their blinding beauty and breadth of offensive spells make naiad queens fierce opponents if forced into a fight.",Nymph,7
Najra Lizard,"Among the smallest breeds of dragon on Golarion, these savage, cunning hunters dwell near the oases that dot the inhospitable Narhari Desert in Vudra. Land-bound, they scamper across the badlands on four short limbs, their speckled brown and yellow bodies blending into the terrain. Though najra lizards live and sleep alone or in mated pairs near their hunting grounds, groups of up to two dozen work in unison to hunt. The lowest-ranked members of a najra lizard swarm leave their hidden dens to target prey with their parching spit. Once the unquenchable thirst caused by their venom drives the creature to the nearby watering hole, the entire swarm attacks. Even when unable to overwhelm foes with sheer numbers, najra lizards have little interest in fighting fairly. They often use their tails to rustle nearby desert scrub, hurl small stones, or otherwise divert attention so they can sneak away or attack from hiding. Najra lizards dislike humanoids and humanoid civilization, and they are particularly rankled by being called mere “lizards.” They refer to themselves by a Draconic word that translates roughly to “swarm dragon.” Like almost all dragons, najra lizards covet shiny metals and glittering gems. They typically hide accumulated treasures in small holes near where they sleep, and arguments over such caches are one of the few things that engender violence among members of the same pack.",,4
Nalfeshnee,"Nalfeshnees are huge, corpulent, boar-headed demons that hoard treasures and knowledge alike and form from the souls of avaricious mortals. Few demons understand the inner workings of the Abyss itself like nalfeshnees, and it's not unusual for a nalfeshnee to see itself as a servitor of the Abyss itself first rather than bow before a demon lord. Some claim stewardship over the fleshy realms that birth new demons, while others guard sites of particular significance deep in the plane's secret reaches. A nalfeshnee's realm in the Abyss can easily surpass the strength and size of the largest mortal kingdoms, for nalfeshnees display a singular gift for managing and manipulating the chaos of the Abyss.",Demon,14
Namorrodor,"Namorrodor stalk the night, craving the flesh of the living. Though they dwell on the Shadow Plane, the shadowy substances of that plane offer them only the barest sustenance, and they forever seek to cross over onto the Material Plane— yet they can make this journey only on the eve of a death, and only in a place where their plane overlaps the Material. When they manage to make the leap between planes, a shooting star marks their passage. Attracted by the smell of cooking meat but particularly vulnerable to flame, a namorrodor's most common meal is a traveler who has strayed from their campfire. Unattended babies are a treat so delectable, however, that a namorrodor will risk an encounter with dreaded fire if it spies an opportunity to snatch one. A namorrodor's skin is torn and loose over jutting bones, through which the wind whistles with a distinctive, eerie tone. Able to change between a quadrupedal and bipedal stance, the namorrodor is an admirable hunter.",,5
Nanoshard Swarm,"This bizarre entity is actually a massive collective consisting of tens of thousands of constituent parts, each a tiny metal sphere barely the size of a pebble. Controlled by a single elemental spirit, the swarm is capable of flowing like liquid through the smallest openings before shaping itself into a powerful combatant, a solid wall, or any other form circumstances might require.","Elemental, Metal",9
Narwhal,"Narwhals are mid-sized whales known for the long tusk that grows from their nose. The tusk, forming from a protruding canine tooth, appears primarily on males and can grow up to 10 feet in length over the course of an adult narwhal's life. In addition to helping the narwhal attract mates (much like a peacock's feathers), the tusk can serve as a weapon. Like dolphins, narwhals communicate via clicks and whistles, and they use sound to navigate and hunt. They congregate in groups of five to 10, except in the summer when they gather in the hundreds. Adult narwhals are typically 13–18 feet long (not counting the tusk) and weigh 1,500–3,500 pounds. The similarities between a narwhal's tusk and a unicorn's horn have led to the narwhals' nickname of “sea unicorns,” but the narwhal's tusk is not made of the same highly sought material. Legends surrounding narwhals have nevertheless attributed magical characteristics to these remarkable tusks, such as neutralizing poison. Collectors and artisans also value the tusks as an elegant crafting material useful for carvings and other works of art.",,3

Naunet,"Pugnacious and powerfully muscled, naunets serve as scouts and rank-and-file troops of protean armies. Resembling a thick salamander with a wide head, a powerful tail, and tentacles tipped with snapping jaws in place of rear legs, naunets are the most bestial of the proteans and occupy one of their lowest castes. Naunets are 12 feet long and weigh 900 pounds. All proteans are prone to unpredictable fits and unexpected action, but compared to most others, naunets are much more bestial. Always ready for a fight, naunets pride themselves in acting swiftly and striking before unpleasant distractions like diplomacy can blunt a combat’s beginning.",Protean,7

Necrohusk,"Necrohusks are skittering, undead monstrosities, created when a humanoid is purposefully twisted into a new creature through necromantic experimentation. Unlike fleshwarps and recipients of successful necrografts, prospective necrohusks never survive the procedure. After reanimation, they're cunning, animalistic creatures that follow their creator's orders without question. Creating a necrohusk is an incredibly difficult endeavor, fraught with error. Most attempts result in lumps of useless, rotten slurry or malformed undead no more cunning or dangerous than a mundane zombie. The costs in time, experimental subjects, and expensive spell components lead some would-be necromancers to conclude that the results aren't worth the risk. Occasionally, spellcasters can harness the power of the Negative Energy Plane during the process, which lessens the monetary cost but vastly increases the danger, often producing a deadly backlash resulting in the creator's death and a masterless necrohusk. Among the Sutaki, only Ashen Swale and his lieutenants, Turkek and Azi, have the skill and knowledge to create necrohusks with any regularity, although Turkek's interests often lead him away from such gruesome endeavors. Necrohusks are created from volunteers in Ashen Swale's cult or from traitorous Sutaki whom Ashen Swale wants to punish with a ghastly fate.",,5
Necromancer,"Defiling the natural order and spitting in the face of convention, the necromancer remains dutifully committed to understanding what forces await beyond the mortal boundaries of life and death.",Mystics,5
Necromunculus,"A necromunculus is a tiny undead servant that can only be created by an undead creature. These servitors are common creations in Geb, where undead crafters and masterminds have countless years to dabble in necromantic crafts and a great need for unquestioning loyalty from servitors more cunning than other simple undead minions. Necromunculi are similar to homunculi, but there are a few notable differences between these undead creatures and the constructs they are named after. A necromunculus may be loyal to its master, but it also seethes with hatred for all undead, including itself. If left to its own devices, a necromunculus immediately begins plotting to kill and gnaw upon any undead with whom it must regularly interact, even its master, even though it has no need to eat. A necromunculus cannot willingly act on this urge so long as it has some other command to obey, so their creators work hard to ensure that they are constantly supplied with tasks to keep them occupied. Despite their cannibalistic urges, necromunculi are gaining increased in popularity among Geb's undead necromancers. Each creator wishes to see if they can imbue even more of their powers or personality in the delightfully treacherous servants. Besides, they make excellent practice in espionage and logical thinking for would-be Blood Lords. Necromunculi resemble skeletal, impish humanoids with leathery wings. They are created from a mixture of mud, bonemeal, juniper oil, a few drops of blood from a still-living mammal, and a pound of the creator's own flesh, blood, or bone. Undead creatures lacking a corporeal body can use a pound of flesh, blood, or bone from another willing, intelligent undead subject, but the process generally destroys the volunteer.",,0
Necrophidius,"Although the necrophidius is a mindless construct with no particular ability to comprehend the complexities of good or evil, these sinister-looking constructs are often crafted by evil or macabre creators seeking to imbue their guardians with a frightening aesthetic. Constructed from bones harvested from serpents and humans, a necrophidius is animated by occult magic, not unlife. Each necrophidius is built from the skeleton of a large snake, but its skull has been replaced by that of a humanoid creature. Some death cults or particularly cruel crafters seek out the skulls of specific individuals against whom they bear grudges to provide the head for their necrophidius. The final step of the construction is the alteration of the teeth and jaws to give the creature a more serpentine visage, complete with fangs. If a necrophidius's creator dies, the construct follows the last series of commands it was given. If it cannot do so, the necrophidius aimlessly wanders the area near where it last served its creator and attacks any creatures it encounters. Some believe that those who know the secrets of a necrophidius's origins can command it, provided its original creator no longer exists and no one else currently commands it. There are also a number of reports concerning strangely aware and intelligent necrophidiuses that roam with a purpose and track down or hunt specific living creatures they interpret as the targets of former assassination missions.",,3
Nemhaith,"This undead guardian stands amid a whirling swarm of shackled spirits that rage against their fate. Bound by a profane necromantic ritual, a nemhaith and its servitors maintain watch over an object or place so important they embraced undeath to guard it. This ritual binds connected beings—friends, family, fellow worshippers, or even sacrificed innocents—to form a single nemhaith. Most nemhaiths were, in life, priests or protectors who sought immortality to protect the temple they served or guard an important landmark. Others follow an endless and even impossible quest beyond the bounds of life and death. A nemhaith is not always evil at first, but the inherent evil and violence of a nemhaith's existence inevitably darkens even the brightest light.",,15
Nenchuuj,"Nenchuujes embody the fear of magic corrupted, gone wrong, or spiraling out of control with unintended consequences. A nenchuuj's eyes are like divination pools, showing visions of all the ways various spells can fail, backfire, or warp. The smell of burnt flesh and ozone hangs heavy around them. When they speak, corrupted magical energy pours from their mouths. Regions recovering from tremendous magical fallout, or where many novices in magical studies gather, may draw large numbers of nenchuujes. They like to lure spellcasters close by affecting a fear of magic, often feigning piteous distress or recoiling from simple spells, only to turn more powerful effects against a spellcaster's allies and relish the horror this produces. Nenchuujes denounce the spellcasters for being at fault in harming these allies, stoking feelings of regret.",Sahkil,19
Neothelid,"This gigantic, mauve worm has a hooked mouth with multiple circular bands of teeth and four barbed tongues. A wielder of terrible occult powers and a vast alien intellect, the neothelid serves the ageless horrors that dwell in strange dimensions beyond known reality—the Outer Gods and Great Old Ones of the Elder Mythos. Neothelids pass down these mysteries to the eerie wormlike creatures they spawn and create in preparation for a future where the worms below shall rule—a time when all other life is nothing more than food.",,15
Nereid,"Nereids are aquatic fey with deep ties to water. They share some similarities with naiads, but they are not guardians and do not bind themselves to a specific body of water. Although they are primarily aquatic creatures, their unique ability to imbue their vitality into a supernatural shawl allows them to travel on land as well. A nereid must be careful when manifesting a shawl, however, as their life essence is bound to it, so it can be stolen or destroyed to threaten the nereid. Nereids prefer to exist in isolation. Left to their own devices, they avoid combat, but when forced to fight, their ability to transform the natural waters in their flesh into poison serves them as well as any weapon. Often, ignorant sailors lump all water-dwelling fey into a single category of “aquatic tempters,” regardless of the fey's type or gender, using these creatures' names interchangeably to represent the concept of a beautiful figure who exists to lure mortals to a drowning death. Whereas naiads have more patience and often seek to educate the ignorant regarding the harm that stereotypes can cause, nereids and rusalkas have little patience for such methods. Rusalkas are the primary source for the legends of fey preying upon sailors, and nereids loathe them for that, as they prefer to live apart from humanity and enjoy the beauty of the natural world in peace. When a nereid learns of a rusalka's increased activity, it often seeks out the rusalka to route them—not so much out of an urge to protect humanoids (in whom nereids traditionally have little interest), but to prevent the rusalka from inadvertently riling up violent responses from humanoids who can't be bothered to note the difference between a murderous fey and one who just wants to be left alone.",,10
Nessian Warhound,"Believed to be bred by the Prince of Darkness himself within vast kennels in the infernal realm of Nessus, Nessian warhounds are the favored guards and hunting hounds of powerful fiends and, rarely, those mortals who worship them and have earned their favor.",Hell Hound,9
Night Hag,"Night hags are thieves and merchants of mortal souls. These foul creatures collect souls in dark gems or crystalline jars to sell in fiendish markets, and are themselves empowered by potent magic jewels known as heartstones. They haunt the Ethereal Plane, where they prey upon mortals in their dreams, debilitating them with horrific nightmares as they rest. A night hag may find a particular target and haunt them continuously over the course of weeks, slowly and cruelly breaking down the victim’s will and ability to resist, until their soul is forfeit. A night hag is a canny mastermind and soul broker, willing to consider any deal as long as she is convinced she has the upper hand. Although a night hag finds it easy to travel the Ethereal Plane and prey upon helpless souls that can’t fight back, these souls are also the least desirable to the evil outsiders the night hag bargains with, and so a night hag gathers allies and minions that allow her to prey on more potent souls without personally risking herself. Their favored minions are nightmares, with whom they share a special bond. Above all, night hags avoid fighting foes that can harry them on the Ethereal Plane, picking fights only when they are certain they can escape.",Hag,9
Nightgaunt,"Nightgaunts dwell in dreams, lurking in wait to spirit away the unwary dreamer. Once connected to such a being, the nightgaunt feeds upon the mortal's emotions before abandoning them—often in places they might never wake from. A nightgaunt appears as a bony humanoid with inky black skin, batlike wings, a long sinuous tail, and demonic horns atop a skull that lacks any face or features. Most nightgaunts have little interest in anything other than sating their hunger for emotions. They find the art of inducing nightmares to be a surefire way to feast, but they're even more adept at tormenting their victims to awful extremes through tickling while carrying them at precarious heights. Nightgaunts often gather in vast colonies in the Dreamlands, where they entertain each other by sharing emotion-memories of their meals through strange caresses. These colonies pose great danger to any adventurer foolish enough to approach. When conjured forth into other worlds, they serve only grudgingly, often working as hard to find a way to escape servitude and feed on their conjurer's emotions as they do on the task they've been compelled to perform.",,4
Nightmarchers,"While smooth roads remain a traveler's blessing, walking them after sunset risks nightmarcher attack. The ringing of conch shells and beating of drums herald the coming of these spirits as they walk the royal highways, unfettered by walls or barriers. Nightmarchers react violently to those in their path. If a bystander is fortunate, an ancestor's spirit might call out to spare them. Those who refuse to show proper deference might be reduced to little more than ash on the wind come sunrise.",,14
Nightmare,Nightmares are flaming equine harbingers of death.,Nightmare,6
Nightwood Guardian,"The nightwoods are parts of the Plane of Wood permanently bathed in darkness due to an absence of fluorescent plants. Here, the flora and fauna require darkness, not light, to thrive. Troll-like creatures known as nightwood guardians patrol these woods to ensure they remain in perpetual shadow. Considering themselves righteous gardens, they care little for the excuses of anyone else—intruders or residents. The guardians absolutely loathe the light, though it doesn't harm them as it does some varieties of creatures. Though wary of both light and any interloping lifeforms in their natural habitat, a nightwood guardian's fear turns easily to wrath, making the guardian a force of fury who seeks to drive out intruders.",,9
Nikaramsa,"Lies, knowledge, and deception are a nikaramsa's stock and trade. They are outstanding scholars, with deep and nuanced understanding of religion, philosophy, astrology, and similar subjects. They take particular delight in exploiting the greed and hubris of gullible worshippers, using them to desecrate and destroy their own faith. Even in their goal of undermining the holy, nikaramsas' twisted humor knows few bounds, and they prefer to take on the guise of divine messengers with boons to share. Once they find a likely victim or set of victims, they use their vast knowledge of religion to impart contradictory wisdom, leading to the eventual implosion of the faith from heresies of the clergy and congregation themselves.",Asura,14
Nilith,"The sleek, dark niliths resemble hairless, emaciated tree sloths. These creatures are intensely dangerous and fearsome, with red glowing eyes, wicked claws, and mouths full of needlelike teeth. Niliths feed off the emotions, fears, and flesh of the living, and folktales posit that those who have nightmares of these creatures are fated to one day be eaten by them. Niliths draw intense joy from tormenting sapient creatures, often focusing their predations on the pious and the just, from whom they draw forth their most basic fears and worst thoughts and revel in their victims’ subsequent terror. More often than not, these despicable manipulators wish to drive their victims into madness and even to suicide. Most niliths lack the patience to spend too much time fully tearing down an individual, and when a nilith tires of its current plaything and becomes bored with its particular thoughts and fears, it murders the quarry before feeding on its flesh and moving onto the next victim. Niliths are actually extensions of much deadlier creatures that dwell in a distant dimension beyond dreams—in a way, niliths are little more than remote feeding machines for the unknown alien entities to which they are connected. Scholars and dimensional travelers have attempted to uncover the exact mechanisms of this mysterious connection, but they have yet to decipher the truth. Indeed, many who investigate the nature of the nilith’s bond are driven to madness before getting anywhere close. The odd connection to otherworldly beings might help explain the longevity of these creatures, as it is believed that niliths can live for thousands of years. Thankfully for others, niliths are solitary creatures that hate the company of their own kind, likely because these harbingers of nightmares have no wish to taste the horrors they bring to others.",,10
Nixie,"These aquatic fey often guard ponds, rivers, lakes, and springs, protecting their bucolic homes from the advances of predators and careless humanoids alike. Nixies tend to be reclusive and try to keep their presence hidden from humanoids, hoping trespassers won't give them cause to act. Stories of minor miracles granted by nixies to those they befriend encourage humanoids to seek out these reclusive fey, and ironically make it even more unlikely for a nixie to grant such a boon. On the other hand, if someone approaches a nixie with respect, or even better, a positive attitude that displays just the right amount of humility and easygoing openness, a nixie is far more likely to respond positively to any requests for aid. Often a nixie will ask those who seek their assistance to perform a task for them first; such requests can be minor acts of entertainment (such as telling a rousing story or performing a requested song), but in other cases the nixie might need more significant aid, such as driving off an unwanted local predator or investigating the source of pollution near their home. Nixies resort to violence only if no other tactic works. They much prefer solutions that rely upon primal magic to defuse conflicts before they can escalate to bloodshed. In pursuit of such resolutions, nixies rely on their ability to charm individuals and, when they can establish magical influence, encourage intruders to leave peacefully. While some nixies try to confuse intruders and subtly guide them from the area, others use local animals and beasts to scare off trespassers. Occasionally, nixies recruit charmed humanoids to act as protectors or help with a task that is simply too big for them to deal with. If this task is underwater, nixies use their magic to temporarily grant the ability to breathe water to the charmed creature. Only those who manage to befriend a nixie are given invitations to return to swim or dine with the fey, and only the most trusted of allies are granted a minor wish. Nixies appear as aquatic humanoids the size of a child, with large eyes, catfish-like whiskers, and webbed fingers and toes. They have scaly skin, pointed ears, and long hair the color of seaweed. Nixies often form small communities, even building underwater societies if their numbers are great enough. In many cultures' folklore, there are stories of nixie nations hidden at the bottom of particularly large lakes.",,1
Noble,"Envied by many and detested by still others, nobles exude confidence and gentility. Gossip and gambling are often nobles' favorite pastimes. Day-to-day life for a noble is often a mixture of business and leisure, and to an onlooker, such a lifestyle can appear to be nothing more than a string of meals, parties, and game halls. However, despite what some might believe, life as a noble is often quite dangerous and requires far more intellect than it would appear—along with a healthy dose of suspicion.",Courtiers,3
Norn,"Ancient beyond imagining, norns are powerful fey women who hold in their hands the physical manifestation of fate and destiny in the form of golden thread. They watch over all life, intervening with reluctance when called upon—or with a vengeance when the strands of fate are twisted and abused by lesser beings. Norns' relationship with the Eldest of the First World is complex. Many among norns serve Magdh the Three, the triune Eldest who some norns believe to be the first norn triumvirate bound together into one entity, as Magdh has three bodies: a Maiden, a Mother, and a Matriarch. Magdh claims to be watching the threads of fate for some ominous prophesied cataclysm, and in addition to assisting in her divinations, Magdh expects the norns who serve her to follow her cryptic commands to help nudge the future away from the brink. However, norns are powerful beings in their own right, themselves capable of granting divine power, and many balk at serving the enigmatic demigod. These norns find the other Eldest even more alien and challenging to interact with, for they believe that while the Eldest wield great power, even these powerful beings should not be granted leave to meddle with fate as much as they desire. While even the weakest of the Eldest could destroy an unaffiliated norn with ease, they tend to obey the proclamations and judgments of norns when they are spoken. These norns, for their part, use their perceived neutrality judiciously. They know better than to issue too many demands to the Eldest, lest the capricious demigods grow frustrated and tired of norns' interference. And so the balance of power remains tenuous between unaffiliated norns and the Eldest, as it has for eons. However, norns know that it's merely a matter of time before the Eldest lose their respect for this tradition and start acting entirely as they please, despite norns' best efforts to rein in their most disruptive actions. A norn stands 14 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds. Worshipping Norns On the Material Plane, some mortals worship norns as deities, while others, especially witches and bards, admire them as patrons or muses. Those who uphold norns as deities are known as Followers of Fate. Norns do little to discourage this veneration, but neither do they go out of their way to support such worship. Clerics who venerate norns might worship a specific norn or norn triumvirate, or all norns as a whole, but they gain the same benefits regardless of their choice. The religious symbol of Followers of Fate is a pair of shears cutting a golden thread, and their areas of concern are destiny, fate, and the aging process.",,20
Nornhound,"While norns typically keep to themselves, only consulting their triumvirate or occasionally other fellow norns, they sometimes require servants to further their goals or protect their homes. Nornhounds are massive wolves spun from the old, tattered threads of fate, usually moments of time that norns severed to end a life. These wolves gain a portion of the same power over fate that norns do and serve their norn masters with unflinching loyalty.",,18

Nosoi,"A nosoi resembles a whippoorwill, sparrow, or other small bird wearing a heavy leather plague doctor’s mask. They are the clerks, messengers, and scribes of the Boneyard, witnessing judgments, directing souls, and generally performing the administrative grunt work that keeps the Boneyard functioning. Most nosois are particularly chatty and eager to discuss how important they consider their individual assignments to be.",Psychopomp,1
Nuckelavee,"When pollution despoils a natural waterway, it draws the dreaded nuckelavee to it from the First World. This spirit of wrath is a grisly sight to behold: a horselike monstrosity with the gnarled upper body of a humanoid growing directly from its back. Further enhancing the awfulness, not a patch of skin exists on the misshapen hybrid form, as though it survived its own flaying. When a nuckelavee rides forth from its domain, it wreaks a trail of destruction across the lands surrounding its path. Nuckelavees are considered among the cruelest and most monstrous fey, seen by some as just desserts visited upon those who would befoul the waters of their homes. A nuckelavee, though, doesn't discriminate between those who pollute and those who merely have the misfortune to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.",,9
Nucol,"Representing the fear of parasites and affliction, nucols appear as violent, pestilence-ridden boars. They pollute their victim's body and mind, spreading not only fear but a mind-altering affliction that exacerbates feelings of self-doubt. Though very aggressive, the fiends are capable of cunning manipulation. After they infect a victim with potent insecurity, they'll offer to remove the affliction for a price. Many of these deals are esoteric in nature, driving the victim into despair and forcing them to give up things they cherish. The sinister nucol may even reinfect its victim after completing the bargain, but a canny negotiator may be able to turn the tables on the fiend and free themselves from its grasp.",Sahkil,4
Nuglub,"The ""towering"" hunchbacked nuglubs are among the largest gremlins, though they're not quite three feet tall. Nuglubs have three glowing blue eyes and black, oily hair on their head and back that covers them like a cloak. Nuglubs enjoy killing with a glee that other gremlins reserve for sabotage. Indeed, they spend long hours preparing ambushes for unwary travelers or plotting the murders of sleeping villagers. Though less technically inclined than their kin, nuglubs do enjoy building traps. They delight in stealthily constructing traps in places their victims consider familiar, such as front doors and the floors around beds. If someone else gets blamed for the mayhem the nuglub creates, all the better. In combat, nuglubs focus on targets wearing metal armor. Some attribute this to envy on the part of the nuglubs, who find it difficult to fit armor on their twisted bodies. Nuglubs are particularly talented at causing those nearby to stumble over them and fall prone. Once an enemy falls to the ground, all the nuglubs descend upon the target, biting and scratching until nothing remains. Nuglubs rarely gather in groups larger than half a dozen, as quarrels often lead to violence and cannibalism. A lone nuglub who bullies a group of smaller gremlins is more likely to get their way, and thus less likely to attack their allies.",Gremlin,2
Nursery Crawler,"The vibrant elemental energy of the Plane of Wood imbues even the most rotten of fallen trees, empowering their remains to travel in search of the best locations for the next generation to put down roots. This mono-eyed, rotten stump launches seeds that begin to sprout the moment they're buried, whether in the ground or in a living creature's skin.","Elemental, Wood",3
Nyktera,"Nykteras, or bat sprites, are gentle sprites known for their affectionate nature and incredible hospitality. Nykteras share features with bats, but the type of bat varies by location, as nykteras tend to form small colonies in locations with bats similar to their own nature. A nyktera's sense of hospitality is such that they're willing to share with any who need it, even bitter foes. However, violating a nyktera's hospitality is one of their greatest taboos, inviting rare anger and retribution from the nyktera who was wronged, as well as their large extended family.",Sprite,-1
Nyogoth,"Little more than a coiled mass of intestines encircling a massive gaping maw, this qlippoth is an Abyssal scavenger, subsisting on the filth and leftovers of demons and qlippoth alike, although it relishes any opportunity to consume living prey. Despite this seeming lowly role in the Abyssal ecosystem, a nyogoth is far from a stupid beast and can orchestrate cunning ambushes to secure its next meal.",Qlippoth,10
Obcisidaemon,Obcisidaemons (known to some as obliteration daemons) care only for the brutality and violence that conflict brings.,Daemon,19
Obrousian,"Spawned from sorrow and hatred, obrousians are undead merfolk who lurk in shallow places to prey upon hated land dwellers. The genesis of an obrousian is a tragic one: some merfolk forsake their aquatic homes when they fall in love with a land dweller, only to be spurned or rejected. Having given up their entire world for another and then feeling that new world closed off to them as well, merfolk can become emotionally overwhelmed. When such merfolk die, often overcome with sorrow and regret, they rise as obrousians. Obrousians think of little other than taking revenge upon the land dwellers who specifically wronged them, and then upon anyone else with the misfortune to cross their paths. They can contort their bodies to take the guise of other humanoids, but doing so is painful, so obrousians use this ability only when absolutely necessary to enact their schemes. While they are capable of long-term planning, their underlying mental turmoil simmers beneath any careful preparation, and many obrousians foil their own plans with unexpected outbursts of emotion. Obrousians are recognizable as the merfolk they once were before they died, though their bodies show obvious decay and their hands have elongated into sharp claws. Their voices are melodic and entrancing, belying their rotting bodies and turbulent minds, so some obrousians hide in tall reeds or under docks before speaking to their victims, lulling them into false comfort with a pleasant voice.",,14
Obsidian Golem,"The art of golem animation is not limited to societies with access to expensive crafting materials or a long history of arcane mastery. Among the resource-poor xulgaths who dwell in the Darklands, especially those hardy clutches that call the Black Desert their home, obsidian is one of the most common crafting materials available. Combine this ingredient with a powerful spellcaster and the xulgath tradition of inflection—magically warping and working normally inflexible stone—and the end result is an obsidian golem.",Golem,16
Ochre Jelly,"Ochre jellies are animate masses of protoplasm with a sickly combination of yellow, orange, and brown hues. Their acidic bodies dissolve flesh but leave other materials, including a victim’s gear and bones, intact. Some ancient cultures would entomb bodies in stone sarcophaguses with ochre jellies to allow the ooze to break down the  flesh and clean and polish the bones.",Ooze,5
Ocluai,"Ocluais embody the fear of being lost and helpless in the darkness as well as the danger of unreasoning terror. An ocluai's gray body resembles that of a featherless owl with a serrated beak, the legs of a monkey, and oversized eye sockets full of shadow. The field of unnatural darkness that surrounds an ocluai disorients most creatures; while other gorgas are quick to move in for the kill, ocluais love to perch on a low branch or lintel and watch with their blank expressions as prey succumbs to panic. Though capable fighters, ocluais prefer to hang back and slash at those whose frantic fight brings them within range, letting their prey's own terror drive them over cliffs or bring them to their knees. Ocluais understand several languages but rarely communicate with non-fey. When they do, their communication takes the form of unsettling telepathic images projected directly into the other party's mind as the ocluai holds their gaze.",Gorga,3
Ofalth,"Found in castle dung heaps, city dumps, and sewers, ofalths are thought to be cousins of shamblers. But whereas shamblers are living heaps of soggy vegetation, ofalths are living heaps of matter from an altogether more unpleasant source: these monsters look like 9-foot-tall amalgamations of wet detritus, sewage, and rubbish with long tentacular arms and stout legs. It can be difficult to tell where an ofalth’s body ends and the foul contents of the cesspit they wallow within begins. They move through refuse heaps in search of organic material in their endless quest to sate their hunger. Though ofalths have a limited intellect, they still exhibit a vile curiosity. They are no strangers to dissecting their prey after it has succumbed to their wasting disease—a terrible and aptly named affliction that causes the victim’s blood to seep from its pores. When an ofalth manages to secure a victim alive, it may even torture its food by consuming it bit by bit while it shrieks for mercy. Ofalths’ domains typically overlap with those of otyughs, who fear ofalths, though otyughs have also been known to band together in order to take down an ofalth for its rubbery flesh, which the otyughs consider an intoxicating delicacy. On the other hand, ofalths seem to particularly enjoy taking otyughs apart one piece at a time. They have been known to keep a captured otyugh alive for days or even weeks, forcing the otyugh to endure the cloying scent of its own body decaying before the ofalth feeds.",,10
Ogre Boss,"In ogre society, might makes more than right—it makes the rules. The strongest or most violent ogre in a family (in most cases, this is the same ogre) is invariably that family’s boss. Quick to hook fallen foes on their weapons, even other ogres fear the repercussions of displeasing an ogre boss. When an ogre boss barks out commands, the other members of the family move quickly to obey.",Ogre,7
Ogre Glutton,"Ogre gluttons take the act of feeding to a horrific extreme, capable of extending their already cavernous mouths wide enough to gulp down a halfling. Stories of ogre gluttons being tricked into eating razor-edged shields or barrels filled with poisoned meat are common, but such tales are of little consolation to those who have been gobbled down whole by these ravenous giants. In addition to their sadistic table manners, ogre gluttons have a disturbing knack for coming up with violent “games” that are little more than drawn-out torments, yet those who somehow manage to beat a glutton at the rules of its own game can often enrage and frustrate the ogre enough that the resulting tantrum is more than enough distraction to afford a last-ditch escape from doom.",Ogre,4
Ogre Spider,"These terrifying creatures grow as large as elephants. The placement of their eyes above their wide mandibles evokes the grimacing visage of an ogre's leer. Ogres themselves find the appearance of ogre spider faces simultaneously amusing and adorable, but in most cases, ogres' attempts to keep these spiders as pets result in dead ogres and well-fed spiders.",Spider,5
Ogre Warrior,"The simplest of ogres are slabs of muscle with hatefully beady eyes, misshapen visages, and malformed bodies. Always eager for mayhem and murder, ogre warriors are quick to turn on their kin when there’s a shortage of smaller folk to torment, so those who lead ogres do their best to keep them constantly distracted with new opportunities for raids and ruin.",Ogre,3
Oil Living Graffiti,"A living graffiti is a painting or drawing that has come to life by magic. These two-dimensional beings can move along any flat surface they touch, including walls, floors, furniture, doors, and even bodies of still water. They can't exist apart from the surfaces they traverse except in brief bursts, which they typically use to harass or attack nearby creatures. They exhibit a mischievous nature and desire to make the real world as much of a caricature as their own two-dimensional domain.",Living Symbol,3
Olethrodaemon,"Even daemons fear the most massive and terrifying of their kind, olethrodaemons. No single entity could embody the level of evil necessary to manifest one; instead, these living war machines are made from the souls of many—or so the story goes. Other theories suggest that the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are responsible for creating the olethrodaemons, or that olethrodaemons are merely the seeping run-off of an even greater being: a mysterious fifth Horseman.Whatever the truth, olethrodaemons are real, and their existence is terrifying enough to instill paralyzing existential dread. With dozens of unblinking glowing eyes above a drooling maw, two sets of four muscled limbs, and countless horns, olethrodaemons resemble no other creature known to mortalkind.",Daemon,20
Olobigonde,"Though the Plane of Water is mostly liquid, it does contain its share of solid material, whether in the form of free-floating aquatic plants, hunks of coral, or even detritus from lost underwater cities. Flotsam and jetsam collect across the plane, and olobigondes are just one of the many creatures that have evolved to live among and consume this detritus. These flat, round fish are covered in a moss-like skin that makes them exceptionally difficult to spot as they hug the sides of flotsam, feeding off the waste that drifts into their wide, open mouths. While olobigondes are primarily detritivores, they've been known to lie in wait within a forest of kelp or against a mossy stone to ambush smaller creatures, such as water scamps or lone passing merfolk. The fish launch themselves from their hiding spot to take large bites out of their surprised prey, then grab the victim as it tries to flee. Despite their size and ungainly shape, olobigondes can move quickly in water, though their bursts of speed are usually short-lived. In addition to maintaining a firm hold on prey, olobigondes' mouths are filled with a unique toxin that weakens and decomposes living flesh. The hungry fish easily gulp down the resulting slurry. Ancient olobigondes grow truly immense, and their outward appearance evolves. There seems to be no limit to their size. Their skin even separates into plates with deep channels where water can accumulate, giving them the appearance of an entire patch of detritus rather than one piece.",,2
Omox,"Seemingly made from living, animated filth, omoxes have no true anatomy, although they generally spend most of their time in roughly humanoid shapes, resembling some grim caricatures of half-melted humanoids. While scholars once believed these foul demons to be a pure, concentrated form of the corruption that suffuses the Abyss and its inhabitants, in truth these demons arise from the souls of those who routinely befouled and polluted their surroundings in life.",Demon,12
Onidoshi,"Onidoshi, or ogre mages, are oni with the material form of an ogre. Onidoshi's supernatural prowess and overwhelming intellect are enough to awe and cow entire families of rank-and-file ogres. Because of this, onidoshi are often found at the head of ogre war parties or orchestrating these violent campaigns from behind the scenes. It's rare for onidoshi to lead solitary existences, but those who do prefer to maraud the countryside or exploit villages and hoard the spoils for themselves.",Oni,8
Onryo,"Onryos are created when a person dies violently in the grip of extreme emotion, such as unbridled rage or overwhelming sorrow. These twisted undead return as beings of pure vengeance, seeking to endlessly spread suffering. Onryos torment those who killed them, but not by directly attacking their murderer. Instead, an onryo hunts down the friends, family members, and anyone connected to their foe. In doing so, the onryo inflicts as much torment as possible on the person responsible for their demise. An onryo's vengeful nature persists indefinitely; not even the death of their killer sates their lust for destruction. Vengeance is just a way for them to spread their pain to others, and they quickly find new targets for their ire. Onryos always wear funeral clothing, often dripping wet or covered in filth. Most of them also display wounds or signs indicating how they died. As they move, onryos seem to pop in and out of existence, making them difficult to track in combat.",,12
Ooze Mephit,"Slick in every sense of the word, ooze mephits are unapologetic sycophants, shamelessly flattering anyone they may be able to con a favor out of, although their lack of intelligence and subtlety means that only the most vain or trusting targets fail to see through their honeyed words. Lacking proper bones, these ocher-colored mephits have bodies consisting primarily of ooze and muck. They smell disgusting, and their touch leaves stains that are almost impossible to get out.","Elemental, Mephit",1
Oppali,"An oppali is a tenacious, twisting vine with white, trumpet-shaped flowers that grows in temperate and tropical regions. Stories passed down through generations refer to the oppali as a “bad luck vine” and warn against letting one take over a copse or garden, lest “your luck drain away like water down a hole.” This folklore contains more wisdom than most farmers or settlers realize. Oppalis are usually 30 feet long, but they twist and coil on themselves so much that they occupy a space not much larger than a horse.",,10

Orca,"While many know orcas as “killer whales,” they are actually the largest species of dolphin. These powerful animals hunt together in pods to take down seals, sharks, and even true whales. Adult orcas are typically 15–25 feet long and weigh 8,000–12,000 pounds.",Dolphin,5
Ore Louse,"Ore lice are six-legged insectile creatures that roost either just beneath or above the water's surface. They're highly territorial toward both strangers and each other, able to detect an intruder through the ripples in the water. Due to their diet, ore lice have incredibly tough chitin that's infused with metal. Cannibalism between ore lice is common when they're unable to locate other prey. Though there are far more suitable environments for ore lice bordering the Plane of Air, the creatures are often found where the Plane of Earth meets the Plane of Water. This was a mystery that puzzled many—until the Plane of Metal returned between the Planes of Earth and Water. Planar researchers realized that ore lice must have hunted here before the planar schism. On the Plane of Metal, ore lice often appear in horror stories chasing down metal elementals and ferociously devouring them. Their connection to Ferrumnestra adds to their infamy.",,5
Oread Guard,"Elemental earth laces through the bones of oreads, who appear similar to stone statues of their mortal ancestry, with delicate crystals in place of hair, fur, or scales. Oreads are stoic and slow to plan but are of steadfast resolve and unwavering in their convictions. The typical oread cherishes quiet seclusion. Yet as they age, many oreads find themselves inexplicably drawn to some far-flung location with a pull like that exerted on the needle of a compass—intangible, constant, and ultimately irresistible. The destination of this mysterious pilgrimage is unique to each oread, though it usually ends in some place of great mystical power, natural splendor, or esoteric learning. Most oreads are drawn to a place with which they are somewhat familiar, but a rare few feel drawn to travel in a seemingly random direction, departing with only their hope that they'll discover whatever mystery lies at the end of their invisible path. Many oreads find that the role of a guard suits their personality well, for in such a role they can feel as if they are helping to promote order but also find time to stand vigil as lone sentinels over a specific portion of a fortification or a remote location on a wilderness trail.",Geniekin,1
Oregorger,"Oregorgers are hulking, four-limbed brutes with bodies of raw primal metals accreted in layers. Driven entirely by an insatiable drive to consume metal, an oregorger stops at nothing to greedily devour as much metal as it can and expel it as caustic rust.","Elemental, Metal",11

Ostiarius,"Ostiariuses, as emissaries of the velstracs, tend to the portals between the Shadow Plane and the Material Plane. They not only escort other velstracs into the world of mortals, but also work to entice mortals into the realms of the velstracs— from which most mortals never leave. Among the most pleasant and persuasive of the velstracs, ostiariuses are prepared to converse for hours upon any topic, and they are skilled at returning, again and again, to the subject of the delights found in their perverse philosophies. Ostiariuses stand over 6 feet tall, and individuals range from skeletally thin to hugely corpulent.",Velstrac,5
Ostovite,"Skittering scavenger vermin common throughout the Abyss, ostovites roam battlefields to harvest flesh and bones. After the ostovites dissolve and slurp up the flesh for sustenance, they craft the bones into elaborate shells they refer to as “bone chariots.” These bone chariots move under the ostovites' command and serve as an important marker of rank in ostovite nests. To the tiny ostovites, bigger is better, and building large skeletal conveyances is the only way for them to increase their standing in life. Although they feel deeply inferior to creatures larger than themselves, this fear can be overwhelmed by the ostovites' visceral desire to harvest those creatures' bones to increase their own status. When confronted with a particularly massive skeleton, ostovites generally fight among themselves and end up splitting the haul. However, there are rare instances of the selfish creatures working together to puppeteer a much larger bone chariot. Ostovites' faint understanding of anatomy results in bone chariots that look more like a nightmarish attempt at art than any creature the bones were pulled from. Some powerful fiends and their admirers collect this strange art by bribing ostovites with skeletons or finding ways to kill ostovites without disrupting the chariot around them. Despite ostovites' origins in the Abyss, they are neither demons nor qlippoth. Without the protection of the major fiends, they find their homes in nooks and crannies along the corners of their home plane. Though they have no innate ability to cross the planar boundaries, flaws in the Abyss's fabric often lead them to worlds across the planes. Ostovites that have thus migrated are often much happier. Away from demonic abuse, they usually can be found near mortal crypts and battlefields. On the Material Plane, they rarely have to face any threats other than the undead, clerics of Pharasma, and families of the deceased.",,1
Osyluth,"An osyluth is an unparalleled inquisitor that revels in the sadism and torture for which Hell is so well known. These devils' charge is to seek out heresies, both among mortals and among other fiends—a commandment they uphold with unwavering fervor. They spawn within the Styx-fed swamps of Hell's fifth layer, Stygia; where heresies and the souls of heretics stagnate, osyluths eventually rise. In the remote corners of that same layer of Hell, they build massive, calcified hives where they perform their vile interrogations and perfect their torturous arts upon lesser devils and petitioners alike.",Devil,9
Otyugh,"Lords of sewers, ditches, and landfllls, otyughs are filthy monstrosities that stomp about on three massive legs in search of tasty garbage and refuse. Using two barbed tentacles to grasp and tear, guided by a third with a proliferation of eyes at the end, the otyugh has perfectly adapted to life in its cramped, disgusting environment, where it uses its appendages to see into tight spaces and grasp hidden prey. Most assume that otyughs originally evolved in swamps and moved into sewers as civilization encroached on their natural habitats. True or not, they are now one of the larger predators in those dank environs. Otyughs are territorial, but they have been known to form loose collectives, even giving each other important-sounding titles like “king of offal” and “duchess of slime” to indicate their rank and station in their sludgy underworld beneath the streets. Those who run across an otyugh might be surprised to hear it speak, shouting at intruders to leave its putrid home or demanding tribute in the form of trash or other prizes of dubious nature.",,4
Ouroboros,"Ouroboros are the embodiment of eternity. Though they're prevalent as a symbol, often scrawled across the margins of alchemical tomes, few know that the beasts actually exist in the Astral Plane, where they fly through the silvery-gray void like a serpentine wheel. The ouroboros is usually depicted as a snake devouring its tail. This circular symbol is synonymous with infinity, self-sufficiency, and eternal unity. An ouroboros' form exemplifies the unfathomable concepts of forever. Its undulating body is composed of smaller serpents, who are in turn composed of ever smaller serpents, continuing indefinitely. These smaller components are recycled as the ouroboros devours its tail, existing in a perpetual, cyclical process of creation and destruction. It is a massive creature, forming a loop roughly 50 feet in diameter and weighing hundreds of tons. An ouroboros's most striking feature is its ability to almost instantly grow new flesh and heal from nearly any wound. This profound regenerative ability comes in part from an ouroboros's magical blood, which is rumored to have many miraculous properties. Through their inscrutable behavior suggests that an ouroboros is mindless, the creatures boast crude intellects and can understand speech, though they have no way to speak. They possess an instinctive, almost obsessive will to survive and defend themselves ferociously if threatened in even the slightest way. Often these perceived threats take the form of another creature simply existing within the ouroboros's line of sight, leading other Astral creatures to give these powerful beings a wide berth. The only creature an ouroboros reliably ignores is another ouroboros, but they're so incredibly rare that these meetings occur only once an age. Being entirely self-sustaining, an ouroboros rarely deigns to emerge from its consumption to engage with the Material Plane. Yet, the creature remains capable of inflicting tremendous devastation that far surpasses what it could wreak leveraging only its massive size alone. Left to its own devices, an ouroboros is likely to simply roam the Astral Plane in eon-spanning cycles, following some pattern too long and large for any mortal to even chart, much less fully comprehend. When conjured to the Material Plane, however, an ouroboros eagerly begins to initiate the cycle of renewal for which it is best known, beginning with that cycle's first step: destruction.",,21
Ovinnik,"The ovinnik is the most ferocious of house spirits, and the only one that will kill if sufficiently angered. They live in granaries, storage rooms, and sheds where food—particularly grain—is kept. Ovinniks resemble bipedal cats but bark like a dog to scare away thieves, and they often demand gifts of milk, pancakes, and dead roosters.",House Spirit,4
Owb,"Commonly called owbs, or lesser owbs by more powerful owb prophets, most of these mysterious creatures focus on manipulating caligni culture. Among calignis, an owb hides from mortals they deem beneath them—even including calignis in their charge. An owb prefers to select one caligni leader to control from the shadows, manipulating them using charisma and magic. Through coersion of such agents, owbs maintain a steady hand in the politics of the community, either blessing and breaking pacts with other creatures or acting as intermediaries and ambassadors between calignis and powerful external entities.",Owb,6
Owb Prophet,"An owb who comes into contact and is chosen by one of the Forsaken gains a fragment of that demigod's power and forges a permanent connection with it. This act transforms the owb into a larger, more powerful creature and imbues it with the power of divine transference, allowing the owb to gain followers and grant spells to them. These are owb prophets. Owb prophets may have some portion of the Forsaken's power, but they use their authority to gain more sway over calignis and other worshippers.",Owb,13
Owlbear,"With the body of a powerful brown bear and the keen senses of an owl, the owlbear is a dangerous territorial predator, fearlessly attacking any creature that strays into its domain. Those who run afoul of an owlbear hear its terrifying screech only seconds before the massive creature is upon them, ripping them apart with deadly talons and a powerful beak. Although their origin is lost to time, owlbears are assumed to be the result of a magical experiment to make a more cunning predator. According to the legend, the wizard was too successful and ended up being the flrst victim of the beast. Today, owlbears can be found around the world, with a variety of features. While the most common subspecies looks like a brown bear with the features of a great horned owl, owlbears from the frozen north might resemble polar bears mixed with snowy owls, and in temperate rain forests they might resemble black bears with the heads of barn owls. Most owlbears live solitary lives, gathering only to mate and raise cubs, which are hatched from eggs. An owlbear’s territory usually extends to around 5 miles from its lair, with clear signs of its habitat appearing with 1 mile (clawed up trees, gigantic feathers, and shredded carcasses). The lair of an owlbear rarely holds anything of value, but some adventurers have found trinkets, coins, and even jewelry in the massive pellets of undigested bones these monsters leave behind.",Owlbear,4
Pachycephalosaurus,"Pachycephalosauruses are normally peaceful herbivorous dinosaurs, but they grow much more violent during their mating season, when they fight one another to win over mates and warn away interlopers. They also defend themselves vehemently when potential predators stray too close to their herd. The pachycephalosaurus's skull has a distinctive dome-shaped crown surrounded by numerous blunt, bony horns. This feature, combined with the dinosaur's powerful, compact neck, allows it to make battering-ram-like charges capable of inflicting great damage.Some humanoid groups have successfully trained pachycephalosauruses for use as mounts, but the creatures aren't particularly well suited to the task.Pachycephalosauruses grow to a length of 15 feet and weigh 1,400 pounds.",Dinosaur,3
Painted Stag,"At a distance, painted stags appear constructed in the general shape of male deer, their flanks and antlers decorated with unique, colorful patterns. But while they retain (and indeed, augment) the blueprints Shumunue imparted upon them, painted stags reject the confines of the Carved Lady's art of mimicry. Today, their cloven, hardwood hooves can crush bone and daub paint with equal skill, and their antlers snap together in a deadly vise. Their torsos rotate freely to navigate the latticed trees of their home plane—all the better to chase prey to their inevitable death.","Elemental, Wood",9
Pairaka,"Often charming, sometimes even seductive, pairakas worm their way into mortal relationships, subtly destroying the ties of friendship and love through emotional and physical corruption and plague. Pairakas appear as beautiful, blue-skinned humanoids spotted with large rashes and boils, but they rarely take on their true forms. Instead, they adopt shapes that attract just enough attention for them to worm their way into the confidences of those they wish to torment and corrupt.",Div,7
Pakalchi,"Pakalchis strive to intensify their preys' inherent insecurity over personal and emotional bonds, playing on the threat of those relationships falling into ruin. These sahkils are among the most manipulative of their kind, pulling strings both literal and figurative on their victims over stretched-out periods of time, exhilarating in the despair and fear for as long as possible.",Sahkil,9
Palace Guard,"Every palace has its gatekeepers. Often the younger offspring of minor nobility or those from long lines of trusted staff, the palace guards are in charge of defending the royal family and their inner stronghold. Their days consist of guarding doorways, escorting nobles to various locations, and keeping those in their charge as safe as possible. The statistics below are for the lowest rank-and-file member of a small nation's palace guards; they also work well for elite guards of a lesser noble.",Courtiers,4
Palace Skelm,"Skelms crave power, and the palace skelms who stalk the halls where such power concentrates are among the most dangerous of their kind. They assume titles that allow them maximum freedom to punish or hurt others with minimal oversight: any vindictive guard captain, tyrannical viceroy, or needlessly cruel magistrate could be or become a palace skelm. They delight in the wealth and status of their positions, garbing themselves in ornate finery that reflects their station. Palace skelms ingratiate themselves with powerful individuals and gather followers by stoking fears of losing long-held or hard-earned power—especially power gained through illicit means. They undermine their enemies by encouraging competition, jealousy, and outright paranoia by way of magic and false messages. These skelms possess an unnatural ability to twist spoken words and worm their manipulative magic into others' speech, sowing confusion and hatred that might explode into violence. A political upheaval is a palace skelm's greatest fear and opportunity alike, upsetting the balance of power he has built but providing countless new opportunities to sow hatred and evil. This conflicting goal leads palace skelms to self-sabotage and undermine their own efforts more than any other skelm.",Skelm,8
Pale Sovereign,"A pale sovereign is a rare form of undead arising from a terrible curse that afflicts only those of royal blood. This curse drains its victim's vitality slowly over time, almost appearing to be a form of long-term wasting disease that no medicine can ever cure. The royal stricken by the curse sickens and wastes away until they finally perish, rising as a pale sovereign after death. The appearance of a pale sovereign is similar to their form in life, but so deathly pale and gaunt that no one who resists the mind-clouding effects of their aura would mistake them as living. The curse is known by many names across various worlds—the Wasting, Blighted Legacy, Unraveled Heraldry—but its effects are the same. After suffering the curse, members of a royal bloodline begin to die out, their descendants dwindling, until only one is left. Upon becoming the last remaining member of their line, the unfortunate royal undergoes the transformation into a pale sovereign, the power and potential of the entire line channeled into one extremely dangerous undead creature, even if the royal was relatively inconsequential and unskilled in life. The methods of inflicting the curse vary. Generally it's the result of rare occult rituals requiring a spellcaster of great power. Sometimes the curse is used to target a royal line abusing its authority, but just as often it's used by malicious forces against benevolent rulers or simply out of spite by the instigating caster. Mentioned only in whispers and veiled allusions, the curse is greatly feared by royal families who know of it. Be cautious in your dealings, the rumors say, and be careful who you spurn, for you never know what power they may wield. More rarely, a pale sovereign can arise spontaneously if the last of a royal line dies while under a curse or due to a curse, particularly if they died with tasks left unfinished or as the result of a betrayal. Any curse will do in these rare instances, and it's possible that the first pale sovereign formed in this way. Though morose and brooding, pale sovereigns are usually neutral rather than evil. They're very protective of their demesnes and whatever subjects remain to them, however, and attacking a pale sovereign's territory is the swiftest way to draw their ire. If a pale sovereign is ousted from their country's central throne, they retreat to any other holdings they might still possess and rule those. The attitudes of a pale sovereign's subjects vary. Many aren't even aware of their ruler's true nature. Among those who know the secret, some value their sovereign's protection and view them fondly. Others are uncomfortable with an undead eternal monarch, especially if the sovereign has become corrupt or bitter. A pale sovereign's territory is indelibly marked by their presence. Plants wither and blacken, struggling to grow in dry and lifeless soil. Wild animals often rise as undead unless they receive special ritual burials, leading to packs of skeletal and zombified beasts roaming the territory. Such monsters don't harm the demesne's residents but are quick to attack any intruders not bearing the sovereign's sigil. Even the living sapient inhabitants of a pale sovereign's demesne tend to have a drained, washed-out appearance, as if one step away from the grave themselves.",,16
Pale Stranger,"A pale stranger arises when a gunslinger is slain in a duel by an underhanded foe. Buried with their pistols, the corpse claws out of the grave to wreak vengeance upon their killer for cheating. Sometimes a pale stranger is created when a particularly petty gunslinger is beaten fairly and refuses to accept defeat, though such an individual must be especially self-delusional to retain the hatred necessary to spur the transformation. Whatever the circumstance, a pale stranger can wield their firearms with deadly grace and efficacy.",Revenant,10
Pegasus,"The pegasus is a winged horse prized for its capacity to serve as an aerial mount. Unfortunately for those who desire a saddle-trained pegasus, pegasi are wild creatures and do not readily accept even well-intentioned riders. Pegasi actively resist being mounted or controlled by evil creatures, attempting to buck an unwanted rider at every opportunity. A typical pegasus stands 6 feet high at the shoulder, weighs 1,500 pounds, and has a wingspan of 20 feet. Pegasi are highly intelligent beasts and have a strong sense of pride and honor. The best way to entreat a pegasus is by speaking to it with grace and offering gifts appropriate to a creature of such majesty. Prospective riders who seek the mount for a worthy cause or virtuous quest have a much easier time coaxing a pegasus into granting its favor. Regardless, a pegasus never accepts a bit or saddle, for reasons both practical (a standard horse saddle interferes with its wings) and purely egotistical. In the wild, pegasi live in small herds and establish territories on remote mountains where they are relatively safe from hunters and slavers. They mature at the same rate as horses and can even breed with other equines, though the outcome of such unions is typically a foal with the traits of its least magical parent. On rare occasions, the interbreeding of a pegasus and a unicorn may result in a winged unicorn with characteristics of both parents and an unrivaled sense of righteousness. Some pegasi carry in them the blood of a mighty and heroic ancestor. These champions of pegasus-kind dedicate their long lives to the pursuit of justice. They possess powerful supernatural abilities to aid them in this fight, such as resistance to fire and poison, immunity to petrification, and holy hoof attacks.",,3
Pelegox Cube,"Pelegoxes are beings of condensed magnetic energy that fashion bodies for themselves using their surroundings. Though a pelegox's true form is a spherical core, it pulls metal fragments of various shapes and sizes to form a polyhedral shell. Though pelegoxes might develop preferences for a particular form when at rest, they continue to look for new configurations to call their own, happiest when they can experiment with endless possibilities, even if it means dismantling other metallic entities. These piecemeal creatures move by a combination of magnetic levitation and propulsion, and when that doesn't work, by continuously piercing the ground and shifting their weight forward, looking almost like moving caltrops. Over time, the magnetic signature of a pelegox becomes visible, etched into its body in patterns of concentric lines. These unique designs make it possible to distinguish between individual pelegoxes even when their surface has eroded. Pelegoxes are quick to form relationships with others of their kind. They delight in combining their individual bodies into ever larger, more elaborate structures and patterns. As such, it is rare to find a pelegox on their own— they prefer to travel in a clustered form.",,11
Peluda,"Peludas are wild and savage dragons that favor reedy marshlands, sparsely forested bogs, and river valleys for lairs. A single peluda typically claims a stretch of waterways a few miles in length, then systematically drives off any potential rivals so that the peluda can despoil the land as they please, leaving clawed footprints on muddy riverbanks, toppling trees, and impaling half-eaten corpses on their quills as trophies left to rot. They venture beyond their domains to hunt, roasting prey with their breath or pulverizing them with their tails, burning and killing for cruel sport before slithering, sated, back to their mucky lairs. Peludas despise weakness and loathe creatures smaller than themselves, especially humanoids, whom they see as fragile and soft, good only for eating or breaking. In contrast, peludas have a massive inferiority complex regarding more impressive creatures—especially larger and stronger dragons. Peludas will try anything to become stronger, including ingesting shiny coins, gems, and jewelry, which old folk tales claim will strengthen their quills and fire breath.",,10
Penanggalan,"Penanggalans feed on the blood and entrails of the young. When their cannibalistic hunger strikes, penanggalans bathe their bodies in an alchemical substance that smells like vinegar. Once submerged in the concoction, their neck rips from side to side, allowing their head to float upward and pull out their lungs, stomach, and intestines. They leave their bodies in the vinegar bath much like a molting crab leaves its old shell, then fly off to find a victim filled with blood and guts. As grotesque as these creatures are when hungry, the penanggalan appears young and healthy while wearing their body. Such is the nature of their existence: they consorted with otherworldy beings, gaining a lifetime of youth in exchange for an evil hunger for the young. But they are not immortal. They age and die normally like the people they once were—they just retain their youthfulness throughout this existence. It can be difficult to spot a penanggalan among the populace. The faint scar ringing their neck at the point of separation can be explained away as a blemish, and it can be hidden under a flashy necklace. Meanwhile the faint, sour scent of a penanggalan's preserved body, while peculiar, is not uncommon in the sweaty tropics they frequent.",,5
Peng,"Pengs are massive avian beasts who fly effortlessly among the highest clouds. Their bright plumage makes it difficult to see their shape against an azure sky, but with patience, an onlooker might notice movement too swift to be a natural cloud. Beautiful and graceful, pengs arise from the unlikeliest of origins: the cruel kun, a hateful fish monster whose predilection for the crushing depths of the sea matches the peng's own love of the bright, open sky. After a kun sacrifices their power for a noble heart by bathing in the sun's rays, they transform into this majestic bird, which eschews violence unless they must fight to stay free. Pengs do not seek danger or thrills; they want only to make their long voyages and fly without disruption. A peng's calm and steady nature is so strong that its mere presence can quell storms and still winds. Mariners and pilots believe spotting a peng is a sign of good luck. When the sky is clear and blue and the weather gentle for an extended period, people attribute such fine conditions to the presence of an unseen peng.",,12
Penqual,"Although penquals are independent beings, each resembles a tight crowd of featureless humanoids pressed together in a mob. Penquals are most at home in large population centers, where they can don clothing to blend in. When large crowds, such as those found at festivals, are scarce, a penqual hunts at night, where a mass of revelers might draw attention but not suspicion.",Sahkil,15
Peri,"Peris are contrary, artful celestials renowned for their beauty as much as their deceptive natures. Mercurial, though never malicious, peris strive to aid mortals, though they are more likely to dispense riddles and quests than to offer aid outright.",,14
Peryton,"The peryton is an amalgam of horror, merging the features of a stag, wolf, and hawk. They love using shadows to stalk their victims before ripping out their still-beating hearts and relishing the dying pulse as they swallow them whole, so the doomed victims spends their last moments watching as their flesh is consumed. Despite perytons' animalistic appearance and brutal behavior, they are viciously cunning and as intelligent as humans. Their preferred tactic is to find a lone traveler and stalk it from on high. Most perytons are loners who loathe all other creatures. These feelings extend to other perytons as well, and adult males attack each other on sight as surely as they attack anything else. Once per year, perytons mate. The males offer up hearts they have collected from humanoids to attract females. Those that manage to secure a mate rarely survive long though, as their mating ritual is short and violent. Female perytons generally abandon their eggs after laying them, so newly hatched perytons must fend for themselves from the moment they emerge. A lone peryton typically builds a nest in a rocky overhang or an exceptionally tall and strong tree where they can observe nearby lands. Although they aren't particularly interested in wealth, perytons do like to collect small objects from their victims. During those times between hunts, they sometimes study these trophies in order to relive the memories of victims' last moments and the taste of victims' hearts.",,4
Petitioner,"When a mortal dies, their soul travels to the Boneyard in the Outer Planes where they are judged by Pharasma, the goddess of the dead. Once they have been judged, their soul is sent on to their final reward or punishment in the afterlife, and in the process is transformed into a creature known as a petitioner. This process grants the soul a new body, one whose shape is the result of the prevailing philosophical forces of the plane to which it is sent. The petitioner's memories from their life are typically wiped nearly clean, allowing them to retain only a few hazy fragments akin to half-remembered dreams. Regardless of the petitioner's size, power, or nature in life, they're a Medium creature in their afterlife. Existence as a petitioner can last for eons, but this state is not necessarily eternal. Deities, powerful denizens of the Great Beyond, or even the outer planes themselves can further change the petitioner's nature by transforming them into raw quintessence, spiritual essence that is then used to expand a plane's physical manifestation, or by transforming the petitioner into a new form of supernatural life such as a celestial, monitor, or fiend. Should a petitioner die, their body breaks down in a process akin to decay, their nature reverting back to the quintessence or elements that make up their plane. This represents the true end of a soul's journey: their associated life essence travels back to the heart of the Great Beyond to be recycled into the Positive Energy plane, fueling the creation of entirely new souls.",,1
Phalanx Of Phalanges,"Made up of hundreds of finger and toe bones, a phalanx of phalanges clatters along the ground in an eerily uniform manner.",Animated Bones,1
Phantom Beast,"The River of Souls, alongside the souls of dead sapient humanoids, also carries the spirits of monsters, animals, and other creatures. Likewise, it draws souls from the broad universe of the Material Plane, and thus human and elf souls mingle with those of far stranger creatures from untold worlds. Like any others, these far-flung spirits of strange creatures sometimes wash up on the shores of the Ethereal Plane, becoming phantoms far removed from the humanoid forms typically associated with ghosts and other undead. The phantom below is one such entity: a strange beast from a distant world, echoing their behaviors from life as they search for their own fate post-mortem. Their unfamiliar appearance might lead observers to assume they're a monstrous being and attack, finding the phantom beast entirely willing to fight back. More compassionate adventurers might instead seek to help the phantom find their way back to the River of Souls to complete their spiritual journey.",Phantom,8
Phantom Knight,"Cavaliers and knights who died for their cause make for particularly strong-willed phantoms. Though their motives vary, these phantoms often seek to continue their lifelong missions even in their purgatorial states, and their strong forces of will make them formidable fighters in spite of their incorporeality. A phantom knight might strive to find living followers of their church or order, or seek out other mortals they knew in life as a way of staying grounded and avoiding the corruption of undeath.",Phantom,4
Phasmadaemon,"Known also as terror daemons, the horrifying phasmadaemons make use of illusions and their own frightening appearance (that of a serpent with a bony tail, a horned crocodilian skull for a head, and several insectile pincers) to strike fear into the hearts of others. They represent deaths brought about by fright.",Daemon,17
Phistophilus,"Contract devils are clerks, scribes, and bureaucrats of Hell rarely found outside the infernal courts, and then almost always to pursue potential contracts, tempting mortals to sell their souls in exchange for achieving their worldly desires. If a target is desirable enough, a phistophilus can offer contracts for prices seemingly lesser than their soul all at once, though in this case, the devil carefully manipulates the price to drive the signatory toward the forces of law and evil, and therefore ultimately to Hell anyway. Contract devils are tall creatures with skin tones that range from bronze to crimson and large curving horns extending from their bodies, over which they often drape favored or important contracts.",Devil,10
Phoenix,"The phoenix is a primordial bird made of heat and flame that dwells in the most inhospitable regions of the desert. Though highly intelligent and brimming with compassion, the phoenix is best-known for its iconic ability to resurrect itself when slain, emerging reborn from the ashes of its own corpse. Phoenixes are often sought out for their knowledge or healing abilities, as they cannot abide the sight of suffering and deny their succor only to the most foul and irredeemable of creatures. Phoenixes enjoy the company of metallic dragons, and when the two dwell in close proximity, they can forge lifelong friendships, sharing their resources and words of wisdom while keeping each other updated on regional news. While most phoenixes are benevolent, they are not infallible. When a phoenix loses its way or falls under the influence of evil, it still retains its strong appetite for knowledge. Evil phoenixes are known to assault universities and libraries in their pursuit for power—not only to gain new information, but also to set fire to the texts and thus hoard that knowledge for themselves.",,15
Physician,"The art of medicine is a blend of the intellectual and the practical, concerned with how diseases work and how to prevent them. The physician can be found consulting well-thumbed tomes while meticulously examining patients to better understand their condition, before determining the most effective treatment. For medical matters, the physician is a 4th-level challenge.",Healers,-1

Pine Pangolin,"These creatures sleep while hanging upside down by their partially curled tails and rely on their thick wooden scales to protect them from danger. One such danger the scales negate is the falling damage from deliberately rolling up and dropping onto the head of an unsuspecting opponent, which is one of their favorite combat strategies. Beneath their scales, pine pangolin bodies secrete a thick, sticky tar that serves as a secondary line of defense.","Elemental, Wood",7
Piranha Swarm,"More teeth and fury than body, few fish command as much fear and anxiety as the piranha. They move almost exclusively in schools, overwhelming larger creatures with sheer numbers and ferocity. Piranhas aggress toward sudden disturbances in the water and can smell blood from far away. Harvested piranha teeth serve as excellent cutting tools.",Fish,3
Pirate,These scourges of the seas are a threat to anyone who spends time away from land.,Seafarers,2
Piscodaemon,"Scions of death by poisoning, piscodaemons are cruel even by daemonic standards, delighting in slow and painful suffering. To a piscodaemon, death is but the icing on a putrescent cake—its true pleasure comes from watching, hearing, smelling, and even tasting raw anguish. While poisons and venoms are piscodaemons' preferred tools, their cruel claws are more than capable of tearing enemies asunder if necessary.Piscodaemons dwell in fetid swamps and noxious waterways, including the River Styx, the Bile Sluice, and the Drowning Court of Charon, Horseman of Death. They are often accompanied by cadres of hydrodaemons—representations of death by drowning. While they are cunning commanders, piscodaemons are apt to forget their station in the heat of battle and slice their way to the center of the fray.",Daemon,10
Pit Fiend,"When an army of devils invades to bathe a region in bloodshed and hellfire, it is likely that one of Hell’s most powerful and diabolical generals, the pit fiend, masterminded the incursion. Cunning, powerful, and ruthless, pit fiends often serve the archdevils directly. They rule infernal duchies, subjugate mortal worlds, and usurp infernal rivals using unparalleled despotism and calculated ferocity. To realize their tyrannical machinations, pit fiends claim mortal souls that they corrupt into lemure servants, which can then be shaped and transformed through infernal manipulation into the terrifying devils that form Hell’s formidable legions. They often select the most wicked and vicious lemures for their armies, drawing upon these lesser devils’ depravity during powerful magical ceremonies to create hideous and terrifying abominations that can cow and eviscerate the pit fiend’s enemies. Pit fiends themselves are crafted deep within the nightmarish bowels of Nessus, the ninth layer of Hell, to serve the whims of archdevils and infernal dukes. Those pit fiends that don’t leave Nessus to command infernal legions in the upper layers of Hell often form the courts of Hell’s elite, gathering cabals and sects that shape Hell’s political landscape through subterfuge and manipulation. But many pit fiends see themselves as living embodiments of hellfire, the all-encompassing wrath of Hell, and thus prefer to dwell in realms consumed by fire. In Avernus, Dis, Malebolge, Nessus, and Phlegethon, pit fiends build vast citadels of brimstone wreathed in flame to lord over. Pit fiends tower over other devils, standing at least 16 feet tall, weighing over 1,000 pounds, and brandishing wingspans in excess of 20 feet. Infernal Dukes Elite members of Hell’s political infrastructure and leadership hierarchy, the dukes of Hell are chosen from among the most tyrannical, oppressive, and conniving devils. While not all infernal dukes are pit fiends, a pit fiend’s natural disposition toward conquest and oppression often make it an ideal candidate for this position. To create an infernal duke, adjust the pit fiend to be between 21st and 25th level. Because of their physical prowess, manipulative nature, and powerful spellcasting abilities, infernal dukes make excellent villains for long-running campaigns.",Devil,20
Pixie,"Insatiably curious, overly excitable, and just a bit puckish, pixies are wanderers and tricksters who use their pixie dust to create all sorts of whimsical situations, as well as to defend themselves. Other creatures often have trouble understanding a pixie’s rapid, rambling way of speaking.",Sprite,4
Plague Doctor,"These healers, often seen wearing distinctive masks and burning powders to defend against airborne plagues, are as much feared as they are respected. To see a plague doctor signals that disease has infested the land—and that it might have already taken hold. Despite their devoted work in curing the untouchable, they are sometimes treated with suspicion, as if they are somehow the cause of the plague.",Healers,5
Plague Giant,"Plague giants are rasping behemoths, whose weeping sores, fetid breath, and filthy fingernails all bear a terrible wasting disease. Like sewer rats or flies that swarm a fresh battlefield, plague giants bear an inborn pathogen that does little harm to the giants themselves (their wretched physical appearances are purely superficial) but can wreak devastation on afflicted victims. Whatever their origin, the majority of plague giants are so accustomed to being viewed as monstrosities by other humanoids, giant and otherwise, that they become vehemently xenophobic. Some of their communities do permit other types of shunned humanoids—especially those with leprosy and other stigmatized diseases— to join their fold. Whether because they are expelled to the world's worst badlands or because they purposefully seek out such locales, plague giants often settle amid abandoned battlefields, sewer outlets, and other despoiled places. Their close ties to disease lead many to worship Apollyon, the Horseman of Pestilence, or other deities associated with disease. Plague giants claim that their kind is as death itself, violently rejecting the theory often touted among non-giants that they are an offshoot of some other giant ancestry afflicted with a terrible divine curse. (Most other giants also reject this theory.) Plague giants measure 24 feet tall and weigh 15,000 pounds.",Giant,14

They exist to destroy evil that cannot be redeemed, and they often leave prolonged dialogue to other angels. Of course, no planetar ignores the importance of diplomacy, but they know that others among the angelic hosts are better suited to that task, while they focus on the larger picture. In angelic armies, planetars serve as commanders or generals. They stand at least 9 feet tall and weigh over 500 pounds.",Angel,16

Pleroma,"Among the most powerful of all the true aeons, pleromas are a manifestation of the duality of creation and destruction. Their physical manifestation is a constant state of flux between these two poles, their forms a shifting cloak of black where galaxies and other celestial objects flit in and out of existence, as if depicting the constant life, death, and rebirth of a miniature, self-contained universe.Pleromas see the multiverse as both eternal and cyclical, doomed and malleable, ending only if these cycles ever become unbalanced. They believe the current Convergence is necessary to obtain this essential balance, and act to ensure that the grand design of the Monad is carried out to the smallest detail.",Aeon,20
Poacher,"Some forests are protected by kings, others only by wild things. Laws against hunting may protect the private reserves of nobles or guard the viability of animal populations of shared forests during specific seasons. Poachers violate those laws—sometimes out of greed, sometimes out of desperation, and sometimes for sport. Although penalties against poaching often include public shaming (see Penalties for Poaching), in lean times a successful poacher is a local hero.",Foresters,2
Polar Bear,"Polar bears are known for their pale fur, with black eyes, lips, and toe pads. They are aggressively predatory creatures, stalking prey for miles on land or across the icy waters of frozen oceans. They are also amazing ambush predators, leaping from the water to ambush seals resting on ice floes. If they are desperate, polar bears hunt not only other animals but also humanoids.",Bear,5
Polong,"Polongs exist to serve their creators as loyal familiars, spies, and assassins. Their convenience makes them popular among the wicked, as each resides within a glass bottle which normally seems to contain only a small amount of red liquid. When addressed by their owner, a polong appears within their bottle as a tiny, beautiful humanoid drenched in blood. Forcing one to manifest outside the bottle reveals their true shape: a blood-soaked spirit with a hateful visage and sickle-shaped claws. The ritual to create a polong originated in Minata and is known primarily by Tian-Sing spellcasters, but only those willing to practice such evil. The ritualist must collect the blood of a murdered humanoid in a small bottle and perform daily incantations, which can take up to 14 days. Once the polong forms, they drink the blood of their creator every day, most often taken from a finger inserted into their bottle. At the master's order, a polong will travel up to 10 miles away to locate a particular person, possess them, and either slowly whittle them down via possession until they die, or force them to attack anyone nearby until someone slays the victim in self-defense.",,8
Poltergeist,"When a creature dies, and for whatever reason its spirit is unable or unwilling to leave the site of its death, that spirit may manifest as a poltergeist: a restless invisible spirit that is still able to manipulate physical objects.

Popobawa,"Cruel shapechangers, popobawas feed on negative emotions, particularly fear, despair, and anguish. Though they're dangerously strong carnivores that drink the blood of their victims, their greatest pleasure lies in mesmerizing victims to cause suffering and spread chaos.

Poracha,"Porachas are feline beasts native to the mystical Forest of Spirits in Tian Xia. In their natural form, these graceful eight-legged creatures sport a gray tabby coat of fur streaked with lines of olive green, but they are rarely seen this way. Even the youngest porachas are capable of hiding within objects, making them incredibly elusive and rarely seen except on their own terms. Because porachas can so effortlessly blend in with the forest and emerge from its dark corners in an instant, superstitious locals believe these beasts are related to kami—nature spirits who embody individual trees, stones, or other elements of nature in the Forest of Spirits. The truth is that while porachas frequently associate with kami, they are their own breed of mysterious monster with powers over time and space that set them apart from nature spirits. The poracha's most iconic feature is its ability to bend reality to teleport, or jaunt, short distances. But a poracha can also rest within objects, allowing it to safely sleep inside. Given that a poracha experiences time very slowly while hiding within objects, it can sleep inside of one for an extended period. Once it wakes, a poracha departs to play in the living world. Porachas especially enjoy resting inside roadside milestones, to maximize their chances of coming across travelers. Porachas rarely tread humanoid-occupied lands, preferring the company of the kami and their natural habitat in the Forest of Spirits. Though they enjoy occasional conversation, they're extremely sensitive to sound; they speak softly and request the same from those they speak with. Their territories span vast swaths of the wood, making them ideal allies for hunters or treasure seekers who would otherwise become lost in the dense trees. But porachas are nothing if not flckle, and typically demand inscrutable favors in return for their aid, such as the planting of a rare sapling in a particular grotto or the clearing of an invasive monster species around a treasured spring. Any attempt to coerce or trick a poracha into service is ill advised, for these sacred beasts have many friends among the kami as well as others of their kind. Though they generally don't travel in groups, porachas know where to find more of their kind in times of need, and an organized pack of porachas is a disorienting threat.",,4
Prairie Drake,"These squat, mud-brown drakes resemble scaly pit bulls with blunt, toothy snouts. The desert drake is the prairie drake's closest known relative, as both share a strong affinity for earth, can burrow through soil, and hack up balls of dirt that they aim at enemies. But whereas a desert drake is sleek and nimble, flying through lightning storms and siroccos with ease, the prairie drake has all the grace of a chicken, barely able to flutter clumsily up a low hill or over a boulder. Owing to their largely vestigial wings, it's no wonder prairie drakes prefer burrowing over soaring. The average prairie drake has a temperament similar to that of a wicked child who delights in tormenting others. They ambush tiny animals from underground and play with their food thoroughly before eating. To assert their supremacy over other scrubland predators, prairie drakes knock down their rivals and attack them mercilessly. They often make grisly displays from the corpses of their foes to intimidate other would-be competitors. Prairie drakes build and live in burrow mounds just beneath the surface of their environs. They make shallow tunnels in search of large insects, rodents, and ground snakes. Prairie drakes' presence helps to turn the topsoil and encourage new plant growth, supporting other animal life and making them a keystone species for the environment. Even their breath weapon leaves behind rich “drake soil,” coveted by farmers and gardeners for the potent effects it has on plants. Being seen as “useful” or “beneficial” annoys most prairie drakes, who believe such a reputation makes them look weak and conflicts with their “apex predator” mystique. After they've gotten too much positive attention, a prairie drake is apt to murder a farm animal or destroy croplands only to prove that they're far from harmless.",Drake,2
Precentor,"Velstrac storytellers and historians are known as precentors. Trailed by horrific choirs, precentors perform in the courts of the velstrac demagogues.",Velstrac,16
Predatory Rabbit,"Skittish in life, predatory rabbits are fast and nimble predators in unassuming forms. They most enjoy hunting birds, squirrels, cats, and other rabbits.",Risen Pet,-1
Priest of Kabriri,"A great number of powerful entities have vied for the mantle of patron of the undead, but none of these is more venerated among ghouls than the demon lord Kabriri, Him Who Gnaws. Nearly all ghouls who are inclined to worship gods dedicate themselves to Kabriri, who is honored through profane rituals and macabre ceremonies centered on the gluttonous consumption of sentient beings. Presiding over these liturgies are the priests of Kabriri, particularly vile and cunning ghouls who are specifically tasked by their primogenitor with the duty to ensure his numerous progeny need never go hungry.",Ghoul,5
Priest of Pharasma,"Cloistered priests safeguard their temples and communities. They are the stalwart keepers of their god's tenets, devoted to spreading the word. Their guidance or healing services come at the cost of a donation.",Devotees,6
Primal Bandersnatch,"Primal bandersnatches are among the most powerful of their kind, due to their ties to the First World.",Bandersnatch,19
Prisoner,"Most who end up in a jail, dungeon, or prison are just biding their time until their imprisonment ends, trying to find ways to make it through interminable days of boredom and deprivation. Some, however, may use their time on the inside to strengthen their criminal connections. Using force and intimidation to gain status among other prisoners, they create makeshift weapons to take down their enemies and give them an edge if escape becomes possible. Even for prisoners who don't become involved in the world of prison politics, learning to stand up for themselves and projecting an air of toughness can become essential for survival in a place where people have little left to lose.",Downtrodden,1
Procyal,"As the most whimsical and playful of the agathions, procyals are the most likely to be encountered on the Material Plane, teaching deep philosophical lessons and delivering wisdom through pranks and impersonations. Mischievous and playful, these raccoon-headed humanoids love to socialize with mortals and learn about their societies. Unlike their mortal counterparts, Procyals' fur starts off dark russet in color, giving way to gray and white flecks on their muzzles as they grow older. Only procyal leaders boast the stark gray and black coloration of a true raccoon. Those who recognize procyals' age and wisdom treat these creatures with great respect. Whatever their natural appearance, procyals make excellent shapeshifters and can assume the form of any humanoid that they've encountered. They use this ability only for the greater good of that humanoid or their community, often appearing as someone's trusted mentor to deliver an important message in a more laid-back fashion than talking to a magical celestial raccoon. They're not above playing the occasional harmless prank on the person whose form they've assumed, especially when they can use it to teach a valuable lesson. Raccoon agathions prefer to use a blade if forced into combat, but they're prepared to use their claws and fight dirty if necessary.",Agathion,8
Prophet,"The gods occasionally send messages in dreams to individuals who wander the lands, gaining followers with their oratorical abilities. Some prophets have not received true divine missives, but have misinterpreted normal dreams.",Devotees,2
Provincial Jiang-Shi,"Roused rudely from their nightmarish slumber, the provincial jiang-shi roams the villages and graveyards around their domain searching for sustenance to slake their hunger.","Vampire, Jiang-Shi",11
Prowler Wight,"Often found lurking in the dark, prowler wights wield subterfuge as their greatest weapon. They frequently feign death in old sewers, graveyards, and mausoleums, waiting for hapless victims to pass by before striking.",Wight,9
Pteranodon,Pteranodons are quick and agile reptiles with 20-foot wingspans that enable them to hover on wind currents for hours. These creatures have long beaks and equally long crests that protrude from the backs of their heads.,Pterosaur,2
Pufferfish,"The pufferfish defends itself by filling its flexible body with air or water to extend a number of spikes that otherwise lie flat against its skin. While normally quite slow and deliberate, the pufferfish can contort its body to gain a sudden burst of speed that can catch predators off guard.",Fish,-1
Pugwampi,"Mean, dog-faced, and craven, pugwampis take disproportionate enjoyment from the accidents and missteps of other creatures—something that happens often due to the supernatural aura of ill fortune these gremlins project. They enjoy preparing pranks involving spikes, excrement, pits full of spiders, and the like. Pugwampis are somewhat deaf and thus often yell loudly to each other when not hiding. Many pugwampis worship gnolls as gods and aspire to be more like gnolls, although gnolls hate pugwampis even more than most creatures do, due to their sycophantic fawning.",Gremlin,0
Pukwudgie,"Pukwudgies go by many names in many regions, but those who know of them agree that defying their mischievous nature provokes their wrath. In ancient times, pukwudgies traveled to the Material Plane from the First World, perhaps in the wake of the gnome emigration. These proud fey are obsessed with displays of respect, and while they first attempted to befriend mortals, each attempt ended in tragedy as the pukwudgies perceived any potential slight as a grave insult. Mortals, fearing these reactions, began to view pukwudgies as nuisances, and pukwudgies in turn began to resent mortals and the gods that favored them. At their best, pukwudgies play cruel jokes on mortals they encounter. At their worst, they've been known to kidnap and even kill those who don't treat them with proper respect. Pukwudgies make their villages in the oldest forests, concealed under hallucinatory terrain spells and fantastic façade rituals. They travel freely between the Material Plane and the First World through tiny portals beneath hills, trees, or stones. No strangers to violence, pukwudgies rarely travel alone and often anoint their quills or weapons with a custom-brewed poison before entering hostile situations. Standing about 2 feet tall, a pukwudgie sports sharp quills growing from their head that extends down their back. Their skin tone varies by the region in which they live, ranging from pale gray to brown.",,7
Purple Worm,"The purple worm is the most common and infamous of the cave worms, a much-feared monster wandering the twisting tunnels of the Darklands that is capable of carving out entire cave systems. Tunnels bored by a purple worm don’t always last long after these creature’s passage, and areas where they nest are maddening mazes of passageways that lead nowhere, yet navigating the labyrinth to find the worm’s central nest often yields amazing treasures left behind by the worm’s prior victims.",Cave Worm,13
Purrodaemon,"Few creatures embody war's sheer amount of bloodshed and loss of life as deeply as the purrodaemons, deacons of war. These giant humanoid daemons are bedecked in black, unholy armor, with weapons piercing their flesh at every opening. Far from wounds, however, these weapons are the purrodaemon's arsenal. A purrodaemon can, with frightening swiftness and nauseating ease, extract a weapon from its own flesh as though drawing a sword from a sheath, and their blood is so tainted with evil that weapons steeped in it become powerful tools of war.",Daemon,18
Pyrogeist,"Born from the deaths of arsonists who died in the fires they started, pyrogeists are roiling infernos whose spectral fire emits no actual heat and harms only living creatures. Obsessed with sharing their torment with the living, pyrogeists haunt the area of their demise until whatever wrong they refuse to forgive has been righted, and they are finally put to rest. While pyrogeists can't set their own fires, they often use their terrifying illusory capabilities and telekinetic powers to lure their victims into setting themselves ablaze.",,10
Pyronite Ooze,"With the discovery of the incredible gelatinous explosive called pyronite, it was perhaps inevitable alchemical monstrosities made of the stuff would soon follow. So-called pyronite oozes sometimes spontaneously manifest from stockpiles of pyronite or other powerful explosives, typically amid mana storms or when affected by powerful magic. Pyronite oozes have an extremely unstable life cycle and are defined by their ability to continuously explode and reform themselves. A pyronite ooze's violent explosions hinder observations, making it difficult to learn anything from the volatile jelly. To complicate matters further, pyronite oozes seem drawn to other unstable alchemical concoctions. Test subjects brought to the Spellscar Desert have been observed bathing themselves in pools of magic-polluted effluvia. Although they typically reform into a single entity after exploding, pyronite oozes bathed in chemicals sometimes remain apart after splitting, creating two independent oozes. Some speculate that an as yet unknown reagent must be essential for the oozes to reproduce on their own.",Ooze,10
Quasit,"Unlike other demons, quasits are formed when a mortal spellcaster sheds a portion of their own sinful soul to create a familiar or companion. When these quasits outlive their creators, they become free willed and seek methods of returning to the Abyss, a task that requires pledging servitude to more powerful demons, so many quasits instead opt to remain on the Material Plane to promote evil and hope for chance and luck to someday provide them with a method of reaching the Abyss on their own.",Demon,1
Quatoid,"Quatoids are peculiar, mysterious elementals native to the Plane of Water that resemble four-tentacled octopuses with eerily humanoid faces on their mantles.","Elemental, Water",7
Queen Sluagh,"A queen sluagh grows more powerful by devouring souls collected from underlings or drained directly through her proboscis. The muscular tongue inside is tipped with a cartilaginous, barbed quill that feeds the queen not only the soul, but the strengths of its owner. A queen conceals her nest deep in a secluded area, such as a forest or graveyard.",Sluagh,18
Quelaunt,"This three-armed, three-legged monster has no discernible eyes, nose, ears, or mouth or no visible means of ingesting food. Its limbs are distributed so evenly across its body that it is all but impossible to tell which way the creature is oriented at any given time. Few who witness the quelaunt linger on its alien looks for long though, as the most pressing concern quickly becomes the invasion of their minds, as the quelaunt sows doubt, sorrow, and rage. This monstrosity not only delights in the negative emotions of its prey, but feeds on them, gaining strength and sustenance from their dismay. For the quelaunt, no act is too terrible or cruel to inflict on its victims, since the more a creature suffers, the more the quelaunt feasts. Quelaunts are known to associate with other aberrant horrors, including brain collectors and other creatures associated with the Dominion of the Black. However, the more prevalent theory paints them as more alien—perhaps invasive beings from another dimension of pure thought and feeling—and claims that in their natural state they have no physical bodies at all. Few dare speculate further; the only known autopsy of a quelaunt resulted in the researcher’s suicide just days afterward and all the notes were mysteriously destroyed. Whatever secrets there are to be unlocked in the anatomy of these bizarre monsters are apparently important enough to warrant great protection from quelaunts, even after death.",,15
Quetz Couatl,"These sacred feathered serpents tirelessly serve the powers of law and good. Some operate directly as messengers and intermediaries of the deities, while others operate independently in aiding the cause of righteousness. Either way, they watch over mortals and try to influence and aid them from the shadows, shifting from plane to plane to spread wisdom and healing where they are needed. Some quetz couatls are worshipped as divinities in remote or isolated societies, and while they do not encourage such veneration, they use the trust placed in them to foster peace and cooperation with others.Quetz couatls are typically 10 to 20 feet long, with iridescent blue and green scales. Their glorious wings of rainbow-hued feathers span 15 feet and weigh nearly a ton. They are carnivorous, feeding on birds, mammals, and even the occasional evil humanoid.",Couatl,10
Quetzalcoatlus,"Quetzalcoatlus are the largest flying members of the pterosaur family and are often mistaken for dragons due to their immense size and 40-foot wingspans. Quetzalcoatlus are carnivorous, feeding on a variety of reptiles, mammals, large fish, amphibians, and other invertebrates. They are not inherently aggressive creatures and are happy to scavenge for food, but when presented with live prey they readily attack almost any creature smaller than themselves.",Pterosaur,7
Quickiron Plasm,"Looking much like an ooze, a quickiron plasm is a mass of the rust-red liquid skymetal known as djezet, prized in the Universe for its magic-enhancing properties. Quickiron plasms feed on the residual energies left behind by large expenditures of magical power, which they can detect from miles away.","Elemental, Metal",4
Quickling,"Few creatures can match a quickling's speed. These malicious fey creatures delight in striking with blinding speed and accuracy, racing in to stab and slash at foes before scampering away for cover with maddening— even frightening—swiftness. Stories of people simply doubling over, bleeding from what appear to be spontaneously opening wounds, are often eyewitness accounts of quickling attacks. Quicklings actively hate the “slow-paced dullards” they encounter every day, delighting in inflicting suffering and pain on creatures they deem too sluggish to matter. While they are related to kinder fey such as brownies and pixies, quicklings care only for their own merriment. They see their own cruel pranks as the height of humor and have full confidence that their speed and invisibility will keep them safe from harm. They occasionally form gangs of up to a dozen individuals, although the group usually devolves very quickly into mayhem, as they inevitably perform increasingly deadly pranks against each other.",,3
Quintessivore,"Quintessivores are cunning creatures that wield arcane magic and scalpel-sharp spider limbs that can rend one's soul just as easily as flesh. A quintessivore doesn't immediately kill its prey—it drags the creature to its lair and separates the victim's soul from their body with its bladed limbs. The flicking blades then pull out the creature's individuality, reducing the soul down to pure soul-stuff called quintessence, which the quintessivore then consumes.",,10
Quoppopak,"Quoppopaks combine the most terrifying aspects of water striders, octopuses, and vampire bats into one evil, water-dwelling monster. Their bodies consist of an oval abdomen, eight hollow tentacles, and a thick, tail-like limb ending in a ventral tube, which resembles a lamprey's mouth and is capable of intaking fluids at an astounding rate. While quoppopaks can clumsily maneuver on land, they prefer to move on water; quoppopaks glide along the surface of lakes or the ocean by thrusting their ventral tubes into the water, cycling liquid up through their bodies, then spraying the water back out in a high-pressure stream through their hollow, spear-like tentacles. Though the ventral tube can't expel fluids, it still poses a substantial threat to other creatures. Quoppopaks have gills, but they are located inside the creatures' abdomens, allowing them to draw their air from the water they siphon through their ventral tubes. Quoppopaks can hold some water in their abdomens for quick forays on land, but this is akin to humans holding their breath to go underwater, and the monsters' water reserves quickly deplete.",,11
Qurashith,"Qurashith—or “gluttonwings” in the Common tongue—are fearsome, bat-like predators that haunt the upper reaches of Gluttondark’s cavern-worlds. These monstrosities are no mere beasts. A qurashith does not simply devour its victims; once it kills its prey, it physically subsumes the creature into its own body, metabolizing the prey’s spiritual essence. Close inspection of a qurashith reveals that its body is an amalgamation of the fiend and its extraplanar and mortal victims, bound together by webs of demonic scar tissue and sticky acidic pus. While the individual personalities of a qurashith’s victims gradually metabolize and diffuse into its very substance over time, a particularly charismatic or magically powerful victim might exert some influence over the qurashith’s mind for a short time.",,17
Radiant Warden,"The enigmatic and strange radiant wardens were constructed thousands of years ago to protect observatories and scholars against the incursion of alien aggressors from the Dominion of the Black. Over time, their roles as guardians expanded to include watching over any region where the laws of time and space have worn thin, particularly near portals and permanent gates between planets, planes, or dimensions. Named for both the radial nature of the concentric rings that make up their bodies as well as the glowing radiance of their attacks, radiant wardens carry on their orders, defending sites from invasion with single-minded purpose.",,17
Raja Rakshasa,"When not disguised as a humanoid, the raja rakshasa has the head of an animal. The hands of a raja rakshasa are more subtly unsettling, for the fingers of these fiends bend outward, away from the palms. More than any other types of rakshasa, rajas scoff at religion. They understand the power of the divine, yet they view themselves as the only things worthy of worship from mortal creatures; not even their own immortals are deemed deserving of such glorification. Raja rakshasas often form close-knit families that work together to bring down mortal cities or to rule them from the shadows within. Such families of rakshasas often incorporate other breeds of the fiend, often using dandasukas as favored servants or stealthy spies. Even though a raja family works together to achieve a shared goal, infighting and treachery among their own is a constant threat.",Rakshasa,10
Rakkatak,"Pulsating organs and tumors squirm loosely within a sac of skin, all forming the misshapen lump that is the body of a rakkatak. The predator's eyes scan the area, shimmering in the smoke like glowing dots. Wriggling insectoid legs—varying in number from one rakkatak to another—hang from its bulbous body. These limbs flail chaotically as a rakkatak fights, only calming when it's time to eat or rest. Most rakkataks fly alone, picking off meals in sudden swooping strikes, but they will occasionally form a flock. Despite having little faculty for communication with other creatures, rakkataks have a certain ravenous genius for hunting with kin. Typically, once one grabs prey, the others swoop in to latch on as well, ingesting their meal with leech-like mouths. Rakkataks possess insatiable appetites to help them withstand the long periods of famine between their infrequent meals as they travel the expanses of the Plane of Fire. As a result, they easily overconsume if brought somewhere with more abundant fauna, like the Universe. A single rakkatak can hold a surprising quantity of offal, even growing in size as its body expands. It becomes more unwieldy the larger it gets, which planar biologists believe to be a survival tactic to keep a rakkatak from indulging its hunger until it quite literally bursts.",,5
Raktavarna,"The least of all rakshasas, raktavarnas resemble wicked serpents with glowing red eyes and oversized fangs. Often forced into service by mortal conjurers or more powerful rakshasas, raktavarnas frequently act subservient to their masters while secretly plotting to overthrow them.",Rakshasa,1
Rancorous Priesthood,"Followers of Rovagug must usually conceal their devotion to the Rough Beast, hiding in remote cave complexes or abandoned ruins; but they emerge from these strongholds when they sense weakness, gathering together into a destructive, homicidal mob to hunt down high-ranking priests of rival deities or slaughter entire towns. Alternatively, if their hidden bolthole is compromised, a mob of Rovagug's faithful might emerge—not hoping to save themselves, but intent only on taking their enemies with them as they die.",,11
Rat Snake Swarm,"A solitary snake might be no cause for alarm, but a hissing mass of frenzied snakes can make even seasoned adventurers shudder. Rat snakes can reach lengths of up to 10 feet, and they gather en masse to hibernate as well as to breed. Though nonvenomous, these territorial snakes will strike anything that threatens them.",Snake,2
Rat Swarm,"A swarm of rats can cause total chaos within a household or business. Contracting filth fever is all the easier when dozens of these agitated or hungry vermin gather to bite victims en masse, making rat-hunting a viable career in many parts of the world as desperate townspeople seek relief from the disease’s spread.",Rat,1
Ratfolk Grenadier,Ratfolk grenadiers use alchemy and stealth to defend their communities.,Ratfolk,4
Raven,"These omnivorous birds are cunning and opportunistic scavengers. Capable of solving simple puzzles in order to retrieve desired items, ravens gather at the periphery of civilization, raiding it as needed when they are not hunting in the wilds. Whether singularly, in pairs, or as a flock, ravens live off scraps as often as they do carrion or prey. They are also unusually social among their own kind, even alerting other ravens to large carcasses with loud, croaking cries; it is rumored that this extends between flocks as well.",Raven,-1
Raven Swarm,"A flock of ravens is known as an unkindness. Certainly the name lives up to its meaning when a swarm of ravens decides to work together. In most cases, a raven swarm like the one presented here won't attack larger foes, but when manipulated by supernatural forces or simple desperation born from hunger, an unkindness of ravens can be a surprisingly dangerous foe.",Raven,3
Ravener,The ravener presented here was once an ancient red dragon.,Ravener,21
Ravener Husk,"Raveners require a steady diet of souls, and a ravener that's unable to feed for too long eventually cannibalizes their own soul. Should a ravener's soul ward ever be reduced to 0 Hit Points by hunger while the ravener has more than 1 Hit Point (see Soul Ward), they lose all traces of their former identity and descend into a feral, nearly mindless state. Even if a ravener husk later consumes soul energy, the transformation can be reversed only via Ravenous Repast.",Ravener,14
Ravenile,"Raveniles are rare mutant lizardfolk who exhibit monstrous strength and regenerative capabilities. Almost twice as large as typical iruxis, raveniles have a more ferocious set of jaws and deadly claws. A ravenile's tail is much shorter than that of lizardfolk, however, lacking the heft to make it an effective natural weapon. Raveniles are as intelligent as their iruxi cousins, though many assume they are mindless brutes from their bestial appearance. Raveniles hatch from eggs fertilized not by other iruxis, but by predatory extraplanar scavengers. Many lizardfolk tell stories—some true, some merely myth—of these scavengers to reinforce cultural taboos against leaving eggs undefended. At birth, raveniles look like other iruxi children, though perhaps they exhibit small hints of what they will become: a stubbier tail, wider feet, or a single tusk-like tooth. As raveniles age, they develop an increased appetite and metabolism. During one painful week at the cusp of maturity, raveniles experience an agonizing growth spurt. They shed their skin at least twice a day, their muscle mass increases exponentially, and their bones crack and reset. During this transformation, raveniles experience immense pain and exhibit reflexive violence. When the transformation is complete, the ravenile regains their wits, but by then, they've usually caused irreparable harm. Few lizardfolk communities welcome raveniles after their transformation, and some settlements suffer so much damage that they must be abandoned entirely.",,14
Raw Nerve,"When a living creature is killed by massive amounts of electricity (such as by being struck by lightning or subjected to a magical attack), their dying terror sometimes causes their soul to linger on the Material Plane. Necromantic energy takes hold of their brain and nervous system, causing these organs to burst forth from the charred flesh and become a raw nerve. These horrific undead float a few inches off the ground in a macabre arrangement morbidly parodying the creature's living form, with its brain at the top and nerves dangling below, crackling with electrical energy. A raw nerve can sense the thoughts of the living, perceiving them as a chaotic jumble that evokes an uncontrollable rage. The undead seeks to destroy the sources of these thoughts, which often means killing every living creature it can sense. Once a raw nerve detects no more thoughts, it grows still, floating in an almost meditative state. However, its fury instantly reawakens should a thinking creature pass too close. Though it's not mindless, a raw nerve can't be reasoned with, and the only way to stop one is to destroy it.",,8

Reckless Scientist,"It's the reckless scientist's job to break the rules of reality, no matter the cost.",Villains,6
Red Commander Ant,"Second only to the hive's queen, red commanders hold absolute authority over the hive's other ants. Although no red commander can give orders to another, they nevertheless work in an eerie coordination to fulfill their missions as effectively as possible. They have a sense of adaptability and self-preservation that might lead them to abandon a dangerous task, even if doing so costs the lives of lower-ranking ants. Red commanders tend to show glimmers of individuality that other red ants don't, such as by marking their chitinous exoskeletons with commemorations of past battles and martial victories.",Gigantic Ant,17
Red Fox,"The shy and perceptive red fox has uncanny adaptability and is just as comfortable in urban areas as in the wilds. Red foxes typically have rust-red fur, a white underbelly, and a characteristic white-tipped bushy tail. They are omnivorous, and eat insects, lizards, and small birds, pouncing on their prey to catch it. Because these opportunistic hunters see eggs and captive livestock as an easy meal, many farmers see them as foes.",Fox,-1
Red Guard Ant,"The rank-and-file members of the ant colony are not much taller than a shrunken hero but are much more massive, at the relative size of an ox. They are somewhat intelligent but very focused, engaging in unquestioning toil if ordered by higher-ranking ants. Red guard ants nearly always attack in groups but might be encountered alone if, for example, ordered to perform solitary guard duty. They typically spray acid before marching into melee, but only when doing so doesn't pose a risk to their allies and won't jeopardize any other objective they've been ordered to achieve.",Gigantic Ant,15
Redcap,"Redcaps are sadistic and capricious fey who thrill in bloodletting and murder. While they are most famous for appearing as wizened, bearded men, redcap women are no less fearsome or cruel. Redcaps are ultimately craven bullies, cowed by anything more powerful than themselves, a trait that leads them to fear and despise the symbols of good deities. Many fairy tales explain how the redcaps draw power from dipping the hats for which they are named in fresh blood. Just as iconic to these cruel little fey are their iron-clad boots, and the clanging sound of their metal soles clanking on stone floors is both discordant and disconcerting— especially to those who recognize the sound for what it is. Redcaps typically stand only 3 feet tall, with hunched frames, pointed ears, crooked teeth, and long, white, tangled hair.",,5
Reef Octopus,The common reef octopus is a risky but valuable catch for coastal fishers.,Octopus,1
Reefclaw,"Reefclaws are aquatic monsters that resemble huge shrimp or lobsters. As one might expect from its name, a reefclaw’s oversized claws are powerful weapons with their vicelike grip and the ability to inject potent venom into unfortunate prey. While reefclaws can’t speak, they are intelligent enough to understand the local language of humanoids near their hunting grounds. The creatures sometimes listen to conversations, either to gain intelligence on the best place to ambush aquatic or land-dwelling prey, or merely for entertainment value—reefclaws are particularly fond of listening to people with high-pitched voices. Reefclaws are usually solitary hunters, but small swarms of female reefclaws have been known to gather around a single male for mating purposes or together for the communal raising of their broods. In the latter case, the females will perform widespread hunts in order to bring back a large enough bounty to feed their young. Such hunting parties are extremely dangerous—they’ve been known to tip over small flshing boats and attack those who fall overboard. Once a reefclaw has decided upon a course of action, it follows through even if doing so spells its own end. More than one reefclaw survivor has said that the creature released its bone-crushing grasp only after its brains were leaking from its broken skull, and even then the reefclaw was able to perform a terrible last slash as part of its dying breath. During mating season, female reefclaws are often a little more pragmatic and release their prey before endangering themselves and their offspring. Despite their intelligence and the accompanying moral quandaries, reefclaws frequently find their way onto the dinner plates of land-dwelling hunters such as humans and hobgoblins. According to those who have a taste for reefclaw flesh, the meat is either delectably sweet (for reefclaws raised in colder waters) or slightly tangy (in the case of warm-water reefclaws). Most civilized people who know of reefclaws’ intellect find the act of eating them distasteful, but this does not dissuade unscrupulous nobles in coastal regions, for whom reefclaw meat is a delicacy well worth the expense. Likewise, fisherfolk whose focus is on the bottom line of their ledgers are more than willing to hunt the dangerous creatures—or, even better, hire out the task to naive adventurers.",,1
Relictner Eroder,"Regardless of age, relictners look like ancient dwarves with deep wrinkles, sparse white hair, and decrepit forms. As their bodies degrade, so too do their surroundings, with even the finest architecture crumbling to ruins.",Mortic,12
Remnant of Barzillai,"Though the Silver Ravens defeated the evil tyrant Barzillai Thrune before he could fully realize his goal of becoming a genius loci, remnants of his spirit remain throughout the Ravounel region. On occasion, these scraps of sentience form a vague, Barzillai-shaped body from bits of the nearby terrain, but when near haunted locations, the spectral force can coalesce into a more precise body using ectoplasm siphoned from these haunts. In either form, the remnant carries a form of Barzillai’s own burning mace, which dissolves into a thin mist 1 hour after the remnant is destroyed. Remnants of Barzillai can manifest anywhere throughout Ravounel, and even after one remnant is defeated, another might arise later on. The undead inquisitor can be put to rest permanently only by retrieving his mace before it disappears, then burying it in a location consecrated by good clerics, where it must remain for at least a year undisturbed. While a remnant of Barzillai can draw power from any haunt it is associated with, remnants tend to do so with specific haunts. The haunts presented on pages 27–28 are commonly associated with remnants of Barzillai. These are far from the only haunts Barzillai can create, however; the Silver Ravens’ records mention many phenomena associated with the undead being, some of which deal with themes of various birds, the scents of mint and tea, and ghostly figures in heavy armor.",,10
Remorhaz,"A remorhaz is an enormous arctic predator that resembles a multilegged insect with draconic features. This monster has chitinous plates and more than a score segmented legs, a multipartite maw, and winglike growths fianking its head. The most unusual aspect of the creature, however, is its internal heat, which burns with such intensity that it causes the armored plates on the creature’s back to become superheated whenever the beast is agitated. Remorhazes are carnivores. Their diet includes arctic animals such as elk, but a hungry remorhaz readily devours anything it can catch and kill. It commonly lurks beneath ice or snow and ambushes prey with a sudden upward strike. Many victims die before even knowing what attacked them. Those who survive the worm’s initial onslaught must face not only its deadly jaws, but also its hideously hot body. This heat can melt weapons, scorch armor, and burn flesh—all tactics the remorhaz uses to disable and defeat its foes. A remorhaz’s internal fire allows it to burrow through ice and snow with ease. It leaves smooth tunnels in its wake as melted ice refreezes to leave the telltale signs of its passage. Most people underestimate a remorhaz’s intelligence, assuming it to be a mere animal. However, remorhazes are capable of learning languages. Frost giants in particular use this trait to form alliances with them. The giants provide food, protection, and shelter for the worm, and in return the remorhaz acts as a guard beast and helps the giants build fortresses and forge metal weapons. The giants also employ the worms as war beasts, using them to undermine enemy positions.",,7
Revenant,"Revenants are obsessed, undead stalkers who arise from their own murders and are driven by only one thing: revenge against their killers. The common wisdom is that revenants arise only from individuals who have been utterly betrayed or abandoned to die a grueling death, but even then such victims might not rise from their graves. In other cases, revenants might even rise from what might legitimately be considered an accident if the revenant doesn't understand the full circumstances of their demise. In such cases, it doesn't matter that the “murderer” may not have intended to kill, for revenants understands no pity and can never forgive. Revenants have little memory of their lives other than anything they might need to recall in order to achieve their goal of vengeance.",Revenant,6
Rhevanna,"Rhevannas are hunters, binders, and devourers of celestials. They rage that virtue comes easy for the lucky and privileged, and their bitter hearts yearn to subjugate the holy. A rhevanna's shadow appears as a pitiful angelic silhouette that claws for release; often, this form is that of the latest celestial the rhevanna destroyed. Rhevannas can't see their own shadows, and remarking upon one is especially dangerous.",,22
Rhinoceros,"Rhinoceroses are short-tempered, territorial, and easily startled, and these traits combined with their innate ferocity means their natural instinct when disturbed is to attack. When intruders disturb or surprise rhinoceroses, the animals respond by charging directly at the interlopers and then lashing out with their mighty horns.",Rhinoceros,4
Rhu-Chalik,"The alien entities known as rhu-chaliks serve as scouts for a conglomeration of deep-space conquerors called the Dominion of the Black. Their masters use them as spies, tasking them with harvesting the thoughts and memories of sentient creatures into a vast repository of knowledge designed to eventually unravel every secret of existence. Also called void wanderers, rhu-chaliks can survive the depths of space indefinitely. They are extremely long-lived and capable of traversing the vastness of space between worlds. Rhu-chaliks prefer to work alone in order to reduce potential overlap in their mind predations. The furtive beings are calculating and infinitely patient, seeking only the most exceptional minds to cast beyond the stars to their masters.",,6
Riding Dog,"Riding dogs types include larger dogs, such as mastiffs, wolfhounds, and huskies, and are bred often by halflings and gnomes to serve as mounts. Riding dogs are as loyal and devoted to their masters as guard dogs, and are ferocious in battle, regardless of whether they bear a rider or not. As with guard dogs, these large hounds can be wild or feral in nature, and, in some cases, might rival packs of wolves with regard to the danger they pose to inhabitants of rural areas.",Dog,1

Rime Sludge,"Rot and decay play a natural role in swamps of all climates, and latent magical energies or other strange phenomena can transform decomposing matter into oozes and other monstrous creatures made of living muck. Tundra wetlands are no exception to this trend. Worse, in such regions, a quick freeze can prevent noxious sludge from breaking down, and sequential years of short, seasonal thaws can compress rot upon rot until the pestilential mass animates as a rime sludge. These rare, noxious oozes hungrily search for and consume any organic matter they find in their northland habitats. Like most oozes, rime sludges consist primarily of protoplasm, though theirs has a slushy consistency peppered with disgusting nuggets of indigestible matter, such as petrified wood, jagged arrowheads, and animal fossils. A rime sludge renews this protoplasm by consuming plants and animals and maintaining a careful balance of semifrozen decomposition in its mutable form. Rime sludges are among the few oozes that thrive in cold climates, as too much heat accelerates their natural decay. Rime sludges can't survive temperatures too far above freezing for more than a few days. Rising temperatures force them to migrate toward cooler climates or cold underground areas. Few intelligent creatures inhabiting cold climates want anything to do with rime sludges. These oozes can't be trained, tend to wander off at random, and emit a noxious stink at the slightest hint of warmth. Some inventive creatures try to trap rime sludges in pits to keep them contained and use them to dispose of prisoners or food scraps. Because of the oozes' overpowering stench, these pits tend to be quite deep.",,1
Ringhorn Ram,"Ringhorn rams, named for the massive, curving spirals protruding from their heads, travel the plains. Though these rams tend to be slightly more playful and less vindictive than those in the mountains, they are no less stubborn or hardy.",Ram,0
Risen Fetch,Echoes of the corrupted soul of the undead can be used to spawn a fetch as well. A risen fetch appears more as its source did in life than as an undead.,Fetch,22
River Drake,"Although the glistening scales and sleek, fin-like wings on these drakes give them an appearance reminiscent of river fish, they are actually distant relatives of the black dragon. While smaller than most drakes, river drakes are more than capable of plaguing river travelers and are equally at home above and below the water’s surface. This flexibility allows them to catch a wide variety of prey, from fish and boggards to deer and the occasional ferry passenger.",Drake,3
Rivka,"Rivkas are parasitic monsters that cling to the sides of kaiju. In their natural form, they resemble giant cockroaches with eight razor-like legs and two mouths—one between two vicious pincers plus a second, much larger mouth on their abdomen. With this secondary mouth they feed off the primordial energy of whichever kaiju they've latched onto. In the wake of a kaiju attack, a rivka detaches from its host and wades into the disaster zone to prey on the unsuspecting populace by presenting itself as an emissary of the kaiju and demanding tribute. According to this cruel charlatan, only sacrifices of blood and gold can appease their master—though of course the rivka absconds with these offerings before the gifts ever reach the kaiju (such tributes would mean little to the kaiju anyway). Particularly heinous rivkas search the rubble for dead victims to impersonate, magically adopting the visage of a beloved city elder or priest in order to stoke the citizens' paranoia. Drinking kaiju blood has a strange effect on a rivka's anatomy, enriching both its defensive and offensive capabilities with the primal energy of its host. Other creatures have attempted to drink kaiju blood and replicate this phenomenon, always to terrible effect. Clearly rivkas have coevolved with kaiju in order to metabolize their ancient blood.",,13
Roc,"Legendarily massive raptors capable of carrying off elephants as prey, rocs are typically about 30 feet long from beak to tail and have a wingspan of 80 feet or more. While their beaks are hooked to rip flesh from bone, their hunting strategy involves grabbing their prey in their powerful talons and then dropping it from great heights before feeding. This method creates a massive amount of carrion, which guarantees that rocs are followed by flocks of opportunistic scavengers, such as ravens and buzzards, who find it easy to steal bits of the larger birds’ meals. Rocs, for the most part, don’t mind these creatures, which sometimes get gobbled up along with the rest of the roc’s food. Rocs usually nest among mountaintops and cliffs inaccessible to all but the bravest of terrestrial dwellers. They are long-range predators that hunt both land and sea in search for massive prey to sustain them and their young. Rocs are antisocial and lone hunters who compete with each other in fierce aerial battles to protect territory. But about once a decade, a mating couple pairs up to raise their chicks. Once the chicks are old enough to hunt on their own, the parents separate to once again engage in lone hunting. Particularly skilled druids or rangers might capture and train a roc to serve as a flying mount or hunting companion, though examples of such an incredible feat of domestication are few and far between. The easiest way to rear a roc is to do so from the moment it hatches, since the chick imprints on the first creature it sees. Acquiring a roc egg is by no means an easy feat, though, and is often a death sentence for the would-be egg-snatcher.",,9
Roiling Incant,"Though many spellcasters can harness the forces of magic in a consistent manner, such power can't always be controlled, especially in the hands of reckless researchers, megalomaniacal villains, or untested novices. When magical accidents result in large-scale property damage and the loss of life, these forces sometimes take on lives of their own, forming a dangerous amalgamation of ongoing magical energy known as a roiling incant. A roiling incant's appearance depends on the type of magic it sprang forth from, though it always carries with it an echo of the destruction it has caused. A fiery evocation roiling incant might look like a storm of burning ashes echoing with the sounds of crackling timber, while a necromancy roiling incant could be mistaken for ghostly tendrils puppeteering shambling corpses. No matter what it looks like, a roiling incant roams mindlessly, attacking everything it encounters, heedless of further carnage it causes. Roiling Incant Variations Each roiling incant is tied to a magic tradition as well as to a school of magic, and thus each has the traits of that tradition and school. Its innate spells must come from that tradition and school of magic, and they are usually related to the accident that caused the roiling incant's creation. The additional damage from their Engulf ability also changes based on their innate cantrip. Variant roiling incants usually have one 4th-level spell, one 3rd-level spell, one 2nd-level spell, and a cantrip, just like the example roiling incant presented below. Evocation roiling incants are the most common, as that school of magic is often the most destructive.",,9
Rokurokubi,"Rokurokubi come into being when mortals are cursed for some misdeed, though often the one who bears the curse is not the one who committed the offense, but instead their child or spouse. The curse slowly transforms the individual into a rokurokubi as they sleep. At first, their neck extends, or even detaches altogether, to let their head roam freely and engage in simple mischief like scaring neighbors or animals. The sleeper may awaken the next morning from a hazy dream of drinking the oil from nearby lanterns, only to find them indeed empty. Over time, the bizarre acts progress to increasingly mischievous or even violent crimes. There's only a brief period during which the nascent rokurokubi might still be saved by dispelling the curse, but before long, they are fully consumed, never to sleep again. Most rokurokubi despair at their state, seeking to drown their sorrows in drink or simply stay out of sight. A nefarious few rokurokubi embrace their fate and seek to enhance their power by completely giving in to the curse. This grants them the ability to cast potent occult spells but inevitably twists them even more toward evil.",,2
Roper,"To all but the most sharp-eyed underground explorers, a roper appears to be nothing more than a large stalactite, stalagmite, or pillar of ice. Cunning and patient ambush predators, ropers use this to their advantage. Ropers do not form large societies (although they can often be found living alongside other deep-dwelling denizens), but they often congregate in small clusters and sometimes hunt in groups. Particularly interested in the philosophy of life and death and the flner points of the more cruel and sinister religions of the world, a roper can talk or argue for hours with those it initially sought merely to eat. Quick-thinking spelunkers can sometimes stave off a roper’s appetite by entertaining it with stories or discussions of philosophy, but ropers do not willingly allow such intriguing prey to escape alive. Stories speak of particularly skilled debaters and philosophers who have been kept for days or even years as pets or conversational companions by roper clusters, but in the end, if such pets don’t eventually escape, the ropers’ appetites win out over their intellectual curiosity—especially in cases where the pets constantly outmaneuver their keepers’ wits and patience. A roper is 9 feet tall and weighs 2,200 pounds.",,10
Roru,"Rorus, sometimes called hunter demons, are brutal fiends that arise from the souls of mortals who mutilated animal corpses. As demons, these individuals don animal pelts, then infiltrate packs or herds to corrupt entire swaths of animals, turning their victims bloodthirsty and feral.",Demon,7
Rosethorn,"These hardy mountain dwellers surpass their lowlander cousins in stubbornness and agility. Rosethorn rams sport distinctive, twisted horns that measure up to 4 feet in length and bear thorny growths, which they use to damage enemies in combat and strip the bark from trees during harsh winters when other food is scarce. Though hardly a domesticated species, rosethorn rams' shaggy outer coats cover fine hair that makes a yarn prized for both its softness and rarity. Their milk also provides nourishment during severe seasons.",Ram,2
Rotbomber,"Disgusting and dangerous, rotbombers bound around on all four limbs, ripping off the pressurized and explosive necrotic pustules that grow out of their backs to lob them toward their enemies. When they explode, the pustules emit concussive blasts of force and deadly pestilence that can infect a victim. Though slow and overburdened by the intense weight of the pustules, rotbombers can move with a surprising speed when they need to hunt down their quarry.",,12
Ruffian,"Using their strength to bully others into submission, ruffians often work as bodyguards and enforcers for powerful criminals like charlatans and fences.",Criminals,2
Rune Giant,"Magically crafted and bred by ancient wizards, rune giants are anathema to and tyrants among their own kind, who were given power to command and magically control other giants. The rune giants themselves served even more powerful masters—potent wizards known as runelords—and in so doing commanded entire armies of giants on behalf of the runelords’ empires. In the eons since these empires collapsed, rune giants have persisted as a people of their own, though to the outside world they’re little more than fabled horrors whispered of late at night by superstitious giants. Rune giants usually dwell in the most remote and rugged of towering mountain ranges, but they can also be found in immense ruins atop lost islands, glacial valleys, or even more remote or magical regions. Rune giants’ striking charcoal flesh is decorated by dozens of runes, which are potent manifestations of their eldritch powers. Rune giants are towering creatures, averaging at 40 feet in height and weighing 25,000 pounds.",Giant,16
Runecarved Lich,"In their relentless pursuit of more magical might, some liches use their rotting forms to hold magical secrets, hiding precious tomes in their ribcage, inscribing formulas on their withered flesh, even replacing some bones with powerful magical items. The process is painstaking, as the soul cage tries to repair any damage caused by such alterations. Creating A Runecarved Lich A runecarved lich trades Drain Soul Cage and paralyzing touch for the arm wands and summon weapon abilities. The spell tome and related abilities are acquired by giving up one spell slot of each level they can cast. Some runecarved liches might have other special abilities instead, placing aeon stones in empty eye sockets, reinforcing themselves with armor plates bearing powerful runes, or even creating reservoirs filled with alchemical poisons or bombs that pose little danger to the lich but are deadly to those who strike too hard with a bludgeoning attack.",Lich,19
Rusalka,"These androgynous, river-dwelling fey delight in manipulating the emotions of those unfortunate enough to fall into their grasp, using humiliation to break their victims' wills. Rusalkas enjoy keeping their broken toys nearby, both for continuing entertainment and to aid in the rusalkas' defense, as the shame their captives feel often drives them to become obsessively loyal to these fey.",,12
Rust Hag,"Rust hags have a knack for technology. They make their homes in hollowedout factories, abandoned tenements, and other sites of urban decay.",Hag,8
Rust Monster,"Found in lost dungeons, deep caves, and abandoned mines, rust monsters are a bane to any adventurers who rely on armor, weapons, or other metal items. These strange-looking creatures grow to about 5 feet long, with four insectile legs and a long tail ending in a four-pronged appendage resembling a tiny windmill. However, it is the rust monster’s feathery antennae that strike fear in the hearts of battle-hardened warriors, for a single touch from even just one antenna can reduce an adventurer’s most valuable tools to a useless pile of rust. Rust monsters aren’t inherently aggressive creatures, but they’re voracious oxidivores, meaning they consume the rust created by their antennae. The creatures savagely attack anything that gets between them and a possible meal, and they relentlessly pursue any source of metal. A rust monster can be distracted by a single metal-rich item, but they are often encountered in groups of three or more, sharply raising the cost of escape. Rust monsters are a terrible scourge in mining communities. If a group of rust monsters discovers rich veins of ore, they can multiply quickly. By weakening tunnels, attacking workers, and consuming the source of the miners’ livelihood, these aberrations have created many mountainside ghost towns.",,3
Rust Ooze,"These reddish-brown globs wriggle through sewers and other waterways in search of iron pipes, metal trash, and other objects that rust.",Ooze,3
Rust Scarab,"These elementals resemble enormous beetles, with thick outer shells composed of multiple layers of heavily pockmarked, rusted plates protecting a jagged metallic skeleton.","Elemental, Metal",5
Sabosan,"Sabosans are intelligent, bat-like humanoids who live in warm forests and drink the blood of other creatures, particularly people. They have thin, emaciated torsos and broad, leathery wings that can reach a span of almost 20 feet. Sabosans' heads, necks, shoulders, and upper chests are covered with red or dark-brown fur that obscures their stretched-thin flesh. Though their ears are large and pointed like a bat's and they can echolocate as bats do, their vision is also quite strong, enough so that they can use it to easily track quarry in low light. Some naturalist scholars believe that sabosans are distant descendants of humans who were afflicted with vampirism but managed to avoid succumbing to undeath. Others posit they were once a cult of demon worshippers whose dark rites transformed them into their current forms. No matter their true origins, sabosans have infamous reputations among towns and cities south of Golarion's equator. Even mere rumors of sabosans in an area are enough to set off city-wide hunts, and the truly superstitious aren't above setting fires near every grotto, nook, and foxhole they come across in order to smoke out the nocturnal creatures. Sabosans hunt during the twilight hours or just after dark, when their echolocation gives them an edge over sleeping prey. They are capable hunters but indiscriminating when it comes to food sources; their rapid metabolisms means sabosans must eat nearly 20 pounds of meat and fruit per day, supplemented, of course, with copious amounts of blood. Sabosans' obscure faith reveres two deities: the slain Demon Lord Vyriavaxus, Lord of Shadows, and the nearly forgotten sun god Easivra. Vyriavaxus has an obvious link with the creatures, with his appearance as a giant bat, but their connection to the sun god hints at a complex depth in sabosan beliefs.",,5
Saboteur,"Saboteurs excel at infiltration, using it to perform destructive acts, whether they are the physical destruction of a valuable object or obstructing important political proceedings. Unlike those of spies, the motivations of saboteurs is not to steal information, but rather to sow chaos among their enemies.",Villains,2
Sacristan,"Sacristans are failures among the velstracs, creatures whose bodies and minds have been utterly broken by the velstracs' torments. These unfortunates are assembled from scrap metal, nerveless flesh, and bits of darkness into loyal agents who take ecstatic pleasure in serving other velstracs. Sacristans are empowered by a miniature gateway to the Shadow Plane deep in their mouths. By distending their jaws, they can howl with the shrieks and windstorms of that plane. Sacristans vary in appearance but are the size of maimed humans. Their features are redundant or absent and they are wrapped in barbed and rusted chains.",Velstrac,10
Sage,"The greatest knowledge comes from experience. Village elders, ancient seers, and advisors to royalty are examples of individuals who are valued for their experiences. Sages serve their people as much as their sovereigns. They educate and try to prevent their people from straying from their cultures' acceptable norms and traditions. Sages rarely take power for themselves, as they take their responsibility seriously to guide wisely and empower those they serve.",Scholars,6
Salamander,"Salamanders have serpentine lower torsos, but humanoid upper bodies with toothy reptilian snouts. Their affinity for cruelty and violence puts them in close alliance with the demons of the Abyss.","Elemental, Fire",7
Saltborn Stalker,"The briny depths of the Boundless Sea sometimes twist large groups of merfolk into swarms with vicious rows of teeth and sharp claws known as saltborn stalkers. Saltborn stalkers hunt in groups, using their drooping, tentacle-like appendages as bioluminescent lures, posing them as wisps or bubbles of planar energy to draw unsuspecting prey into clever ambushes.",,13
Samsaran Anchorite,"A unique connection to the cycle of life and death defines the mortal lives of samsarans. With a tendency toward reclusiveness, samsarans have delicate builds, enigmatic and pupilless eyes, and blood as clear as water. When a samsaran dies, their body vanishes and their soul instantly reincarnates into a newborn child elsewhere on the same plane: usually another samsaran, but occasionally a humanoid of a different ancestry. Though all samsarans have an innate understanding of their nature, they consciously remember little from their former lives. Some, however, are occasionally struck by disjointed memories or flashes of déjà vu linked to a previous existence that can earn them a reputation for preternatural wisdom and insight. Most samsarans prefer to lead studious lives filled with moments of deep reflection. Their sights remain set on the eternal and on enlightenment, reducing the appeal of the short-term material gains one can achieve in just one lifetime. A samsaran ceases their cycle of reincarnation only upon reaching perfect state of enlightenment—or falling so far from harmony that they proceed to a doomed afterlife. The ancestral home of the samsarans lies in Zi Ha, a remote mountain nation in Tian Xia. These treacherous mountains help ensure the solitude most samsarans prefer, and they're further protected by misguiding illusions, defensive wards, and secure fortifications.",Samsaran,1
Sand Sentry,"Shifting back and forth between a detailed likeness of a human and a muted and featureless bipedal form, this creature of pure sand moves with an eerie grace. The sand sentry is often called upon by spellcasters to stand guard over an area of great importance—these elementals are patient participants in such roles, making them well suited for long-term service.","Elemental, Earth",6
Sanzuwu,"Those who feast on the sun are said to carry its power within them. Sanzuwus are small crows with red plumage and dark throats. According to legend, they stole their burning power from the sun and now fly across the sky as blinding streaks of fire. When they land on the earth, it ignites around them, causing unbound destruction. A handful of people worship these radiant birds and inscribe their three-legged visage on coins, items, and weapons.",,15
Sard,"An immense, gnarled, tree awoken with raw, primal power by one of the fey Eldest of the First World, this monster—one of the legendary Tane—skitters on huge, spidery roots and thrashes its branches as fiery lightning courses within its blackened bark, a living manifestation of the violent clash between ancient forest and stormy sky.",,19
Sarglagon,"Sarglagons dwell in Hell's myriad waterways, lakes, and oceans. They serve as guardians of the Academy of Lies—the repository of secrets in Stygia, the fifth layer of Hell. Sarglagons breathe water and air with equal ease, and can move through water, land, and even air with uncanny swiftness. Few fiends travel the waterways of the multiverse, but where a river crosses the planes, odds are sarglagons have traveled it to further their infernal machinations. The only body of water they avoid is the River Styx, as the fiends have yet to develop any defense against that waterway's memory-sapping qualities. Mortal spellcasters sometimes bind sarglagons as guardians of precious secrets or treasures, particularly in aquatic areas. Most strangely, sarglagons sometimes act as unnerving caretakers to mortals who have no idea what they did to earn their unwanted protectors' attention. The constant uninvited vigilance of these devils is often disturbing and stifling to their wards.",Devil,8
Sasquatch,"The elusive sasquatches dwell in the deepest, most remote and secluded tracts of wilderness. They avoid confrontations with humanoids unless drawn out by curiosity. In such cases, glimpses through the underbrush are typically the best an onlooker can hope for, as sasquatches are perfectly content to live their lives in peace hidden in the deep thickets of the wild. Despite their considerable bulk, sasquatches are capable of moving through forests with surprising grace and efficiency. Often, their distinctively pungent odor or the discovery of a few sets of unusually oversized footprints are the only signs of their presence. These footprints have helped to engender a popular nickname, “bigfoot,” for these mysterious creatures. While normally nonconfrontational, a sasquatch can be driven to violence when startled or when their homeland is threatened, be it by the expansion of pioneers or the intrusion of fell supernatural influences. Usually, a sasquatch's attack lasts as long as it takes to frighten away a foe; they rarely pursue those who flee from their displays of dominance. Sasquatches speak their own language, which mixes sounds easily mistaken for ambient wildlife calls and knocking—most often by striking a solid surface (such as a tree) with a branch or a stone—allowing a whole family of sasquatches to carry on conversations without alerting nearby humanoids. Even in death they avoid leaving traces behind, for when a sasquatch dies, their kin take pains to bury the body deep and hide the grave site well to protect the remains from scavengers and evil spirits alike.",,2
Satyr,"To a satyr, life is a party and everyone is invited. Notorious for their hedonism, these fey believe there’s no greater beauty than can be found in song, drink, indulgent meals, and carnal pleasures. Satyrs use their enchanting songs and natural charm to encourage all manner of people to follow their true desires and free themselves from society’s rules. This usually involves enticing mortals to join raucous parties or engage in trysts in moonlit glades. If a potential companion rejects a satyr’s advances, however, the satyr has little interest in continuing a conversation and goes off to find more amenable revelers. The lifestyle of a satyr leaves no room for ongoing affairs or long-term friends. Once his party is over or his lust is satiated, the satyr disappears back into the forest. The offspring satyrs leave behind are satyrs themselves, and usually end up being taken from their cradles by other fey rather than being left in mortals’ care. Satyrs are always male. The untouched beauty of the forest is sacred and precious to a satyr. Brutish intruders who clear-cut trees or massacre animals without eating them risk drawing a satyr’s ire. A satyr so provoked uses his spells to undermine foes and attempts to dispatch them either with brutal ambushes or by leading a rush of forest animals to attack. Other fey, particularly good fey, look upon satyrs as loutish, embarrassing cousins. They’re rarely hostile toward satyrs, but most find them insufferable and advise any mortals they like to steer clear of satyrs’ glades.",,4
Saurian Warmonger,These saurians adopt warfare as their primary role and greatest calling. They particularly excel at taking slaves.,Saurian,16

Scalathrax,"These slippery, scaly horrors dwell in remote cave networks in the Darklands, preferring to nest in narrow fissures. When on the hunt, they flick barbs from their long legs, or spray down their foes with a clear, toxic oil. The same oil coats the scalathrax's body, all of which is quite flammable—whether it's coating a victim or the scalathrax itself. While a scalathrax appears feral, it's more intelligent than it seems and is capable of speaking in a wet, slithery voice. The vast majority of scalathraxes are foul-tempered and quick to anger, and most of them enjoy killing. It's possible to forge an alliance with a scalathrax, but doing so requires either constant bribes of new creatures to kill or a particularly intimidating personality—scalathraxes often respect bullies, seeing in them a mirror of their own cruel values.",,4
Scalescribe,"Often seen at the sides of spellcasters, scalescribes are tiny, snakelike creatures with numerous hands that usually hold a multitude of fountain pens in various ink colors. The words scrawled across their bodies shift depending on what texts they've encountered recently. Scalescribes have a fondness for language, especially magical language, and make their homes in libraries or other places of learning.",,3
Scarecophagus,"Originally created by Gebbite necromancers during the war against Nex, the scarecophagus is an evil construct that draws power directly from the undead mummy trapped forever within its sealed core. This necromantic energy is channeled throughout the construct's body, allowing it to scuttle about on legs of stone, animate tentacles to strike at foes, and use the mummy's trapped mind for its own sapience and magical powers.",,6
Scarecrow,"A ramshackle collection of materials in a human shape, the scarecrow construct is indistinguishable from a normal scarecrow until it slowly creaks to life. As it animates, its carved pumpkin or sackcloth face bursts into eldritch flame, sending fear creeping into the air around it. Each scarecrow is handcrafted and unique in its appearance, though most are 5 to 6 feet tall and constructed of a combination of wood, cloth, rope, straw, sawdust, discarded husks and cobs, and similar materials, all dressed in ragged pastoral garments. This rudimentary construction makes a scarecrow somewhat fragile, prone to snapping limbs in the crush of battle. Yet its structure is adaptable, allowing it to reshape another piece of itself into a clawed limb or grip a severed portion of itself to swat at its foes. When a scarecrow is created, it must be anointed with a drop of its creator's blood into each of its eyes. This blood soaks into the material and siphons a tiny sliver of the creator's soul away—not enough to harm the creator, but more than enough to imbue the scarecrow with an instinctive intellect that allows it to follow commands as eagerly as a well-trained (if ill-tempered) guard dog. When a scarecrow is destroyed, the blood leaks back out from its eyes, but the portion of the creator's soul never returns.",,4
Sceaduinar,"Strange creatures born from jagged crystals in the heart of the Negative Energy Plane, sceaduinar are fueled by its negative energy and driven to extinguish all life. Resembling crystalline gargoyles with serrated limbs and sharp, bat-like faces, sceaduinar stand about 7 feet tall and weigh around 100 pounds. These malevolent beings sometimes gather in great packs of their own kind. Despite their intelligence, they act like cunning, feral beasts for the most part, though they occasionally build tools to aid them in extinguishing life. Sceaduinar sail through the great voids of their home plane, seeking to destroy any sparks of life that find their way into that deadly realm—even the twisted sparks found in undead creatures. When they discover portals to other planes, sceaduinar swarm through in great numbers, slaughtering all they come across. While dwelling outside the Negative Energy plane is uncomfortable for sceaduinar, they can exist for extended periods of time apart from their home. Of course, the feeling of a plane where negative energy isn't the rule doesn't improve these creatures' attitude, and as a result, they tend to be particularly cruel and violent when encountered in such realms.",,7

Scrabbling Ribcage,"The ribs of a scrabbling ribcage are connected to either a sternum or vertebral column, but not both, allowing the ribs to function as legs.",Animated Bones,1
Screaming Sulfur,"A screaming sulfur is a creature born from gasping death and suffocating suffering. When an earthquake or other geological phenomena releases toxic gases, these gases can build up beneath lakes and other large bodies of water. Eventually, they escape the water, expanding into massive clouds that cover the immediate area. Its silent, unexpected arrival can take thousands of lives in an instant. Confused, in pain, and desperate for a way out, the dying souls become trapped in the noxious cloud and amass into this horrifying creature. While not truly undead, a screaming sulfur shares many similarities with undead creatures, including the malice of vengeful spirits and the hatred of all living creatures who breathe freely and painlessly. A screaming sulfur resembles a cloud made of countless, featureless faces, mouths agape and releasing ghastly wails.",,10
Scrit,"Scrits are short, spindly gremlins with gray or beige leathery skin and a coat of smeared ink on their fingers. They make themselves the nightmare of many scribes and librarians, as they delight in nothing more than destroying books, scrolls, artwork, and other records or writing. The oils on a scrit's skin smears ink and renders text—even magical writing— completely illegible. Once they have smeared every page of a book, scrits devour them whole, absorbing the contents the book used to hold. After eating books they find stupid or funny, scrits hold skits for other gremlins which mock the mortal authors for the amusement of the other fey.",Gremlin,0
Scythe Tree,"Malevolent, vicious, and cruel, scythe trees pose as normal trees near deep forest paths, where they wait to slaughter passersby. Instead of drawing sustenance from light and soil, scythe trees gorge themselves on the flesh, blood, and bone of sapient creatures. Nothing is more delectable to scythe trees than a kind-hearted gnome or an altruistic dryad who believes that a scythe tree can be redeemed. The screams and whimpers of these victims are music to these cruel plants and add an extra dimension of flavor to the meal. Scythe trees are solitary creatures by nature, and their size and power mean that they don't need to compete for food with other carnivorous plants. Once food sources dwindle in an area, scythe trees move on to another location. When a scythe tree dwells in a location for many months or years, it leaves traces of its bark and roots in the soil. Over time, these blood-nourished fragments might grow into a new scythe tree, but the progenitor will most likely have already moved on to new hunting grounds long before the new scythe tree reaches maturity. Scythe trees appear as dead or dying deciduous trees with long, twisted branches that end in scythe-like blades. These carnivorous plants have dark-brown bark that is nearly black near the bottom of the trunk and rusty brown leaves that remain attached year-round. Scythe trees' disturbing mouths remain closed when not eating, appearing as a jagged gash on the trunk. When scythe trees deign to speak, their voices are rough, deep, and mocking, particularly when discussing arboreals, whom scythe trees universally find to be insufferable and worthy of little more than being hacked to pieces.",,6

Sea Drake,"Long and slender, sea drakes have fins down the length of their backs and webbing between their talons, making them just as adapted for gliding through ocean waves as the skies above. More solitary than most drakes, they hunt and live alone. Although most sea drakes make their roosts high on ocean-facing cliffs, it isn't unheard of for them to dwell in underwater caves, living entirely aquatic lives.",Drake,6
Sea Hag,"Sea hags kill and eat fishers and sailors who come near their lairs, torment coastal dwellers with dark promises and vague threats, and enjoy the act of causing distress and discord in small towns. They generally avoid making their lairs too close to civilization, however, to avoid drawing enemies to their homes. Sea hags are known for tempting desperate victims into tragic and inescapable bargains, deals which the hag has already secretly stacked in her favor. Despite their voracious appetites, sea hags appear hideously emaciated, and unlike more powerful hags, they lack the ability to magically disguise their form. Sea hags can join covens, but their aquatic nature often prevents them from joining mixed covens with other kinds of hags.",Hag,3
Sea Serpent,"These fabled beasts resemble massive snakes with long rows of finned spines down their back. Temperamental and territorial, sea serpents can capsize a boat with ease, and most won’t hesitate to do so when hungry or threatened. Stories abound of aggrieved captains who spend their entire lives hunting down the elusive monster that sunk their ships and took their livelihoods. These hunts rely on rumors and glimpses of the beasts, as few survive the catastrophes wrought by sea serpents. While many fishermen’s tales paint sea serpents as divinely appointed guardians of the ocean or, alternately, as evil and demonic agents, the truth is that most sea serpents are simply very large beasts with a knack for avoiding magical detection.",,12
Sea Snake,"These lithe snakes like to frequent the shallow waters of tropical seas. Their 4-foot-long, blue-green bodies easily blend into the water where they lurk to ambush prey. Tales speak of massive sea snakes that swim in deeper waters and follow ships, waiting for sailors to fall overboard or climbing the side to snatch them from the deck.",Snake,0
Seaweed Leshy,"Calmer than most of their other botanical brethren, seaweed leshys are a tranquil, discerning breed of leshy. They seek to mimic the ocean in their attitudes, moving with the waves of life and accepting what comes and goes while acknowledging the good and the bad. Seaweed leshys make their homes in tidal pools surrounded by other sea creatures. They believe their freshwater counterparts to be sheltered and naive, living in their secluded ponds and babbling brooks, though this doesn't stop them from forming friendships with freshwater leshys. Seaweed leshys vary in size, shape, and physical makeup. While the majority of seaweed leshys reach about 2 feet in height, some remain as small bundles of strands that stand about 6 to 8 inches tall.",Leshy,3
Seetangeist,"Seetangeists are composed of the bloated corpses of marine life, encrusted with bleached coral and wrapped in rotting seaweed. Although occasionally created by water-breathing necromancers, seetangeists most often arise when an aquatic ecosystem collapses, resulting in the deaths of countless creatures. Bound by spiritual trauma, these corpses merge together, forming a writhing school of flesh and decaying plant matter that seeks out and consumes what life remains in the region. The disasters that lead to the creation of seetangeists are typically caused by mortal interference: overhunting, ecological overexploitation, pollution, or necromantic magic and experimentation.",Verdorite,12
Seething Spirit,"Hatred so powerful it lives beyond the grave—this sentiment animates the ephemeral crimson apparitions known as seething spirits. Single-minded in nature, they stoke the fires of anger and hate, capable of planning and strategy, but the one thing beyond their grasp is personal growth. Though similar to ghosts, seething spirits retain much less of their former living selves. Most of their soul has moved on, and only the fury remains. There's no way to set a seething spirit to rest: only violence can destroy it. By possessing a creature and nurturing the seeds of resentment and rage already within its mind, a seething spirit can greatly alter the host's behavior and personality. When broached about such changes, a host might claim they're just finally “telling it like it is.” Because a seething spirit can't voluntarily end its possession, it's essentially one with its victim until the victim's rage results in death. A seething spirit doesn't take pleasure in this death—they rapidly move on in search of a new rageful host.",,11
Sepid,"Sepids are the brutal warlords of the divs, delighting in violence against mortals and their own particular flavor of vengeance. Inveterate liars, sepids can't help but spout the most outrageous lies, and their form and nature represent the power of falsehoods to snowball into violence that can cost countless lives. Among mortals, they rally troops to incite rebellion, war, and other forms of carnage, savoring mortals who slaughter each other. These giant beings usually stand around 13 feet tall; they wade through battlefields seeking out heroes and generals, rejoicing maniacally as they cut their foes down.",Div,14
Serpentfolk Granitescale,"Many burly aapoph serpentfolk bear minor mutations. Granitescales have bulky frames covered in hard, speckled gray plates. These scales offer additional protection but shed when struck with too much force. As granitescales regrow lost scales quickly, they make effective long-term sentinels and vanguards for guerilla tactics. Granitescales like to carve their shed scales into small chips and attach them as rattles to the ends of their spears. Many an unsuspecting victim has heard the shaking hiss of a granitescale's rattle too late.",Serpentfolk,6
Serpentfolk Venom Caller,"Venom callers are zyss serpentfolk spellcasters that specialize in the use of acid and poison magic, viewing them as natural extensions of their inherent venom. They have a reputation for bold action, something that puts them at odds with other zyss who prefer stealth and subterfuge. When a venom caller can't eliminate their rivals to seize control of their colony, they often leave in a dramatic demonstration of arrogance, insisting that slithering in shadows does the serpentfolk cause no favors. Though venom callers aren't considered subtle by their kin, their schemes—which often revolve around acquiring rare magical lore—can nevertheless take humanoid communities by surprise. Venom callers often lure away unsuspecting victims, murder them, and disfigure their venom-wracked bodies with acid; the venom caller then assumes the victim's form. Authorities, believing all members of the community are accounted for, assume the unrecognizable corpse must have been a traveler. Most venom callers have broken with other serpentfolk communities and have no qualms about murdering their kin or infiltrating other serpentfolk cells if it serves their purposes.",Serpentfolk,7

Shabti Redeemer,"Cobbled together from broken bits of mortal souls, shabti are facsimiles of wealthy or powerful mortals seeking to escape punishment for their sins upon death. Those rulers and nobles afraid of Pharasma's judgment use the shabti to receive cosmic punishment in their stead. Unaware that they're copies of another soul, shabti endure this fate for some time before being discovered by Pharasma's psychopomps, who reveal the truth to the shabti and strive to met out the avoided punishment to the shabti's creator, using whatever information available. In this case, the shabti is liberated and left to wander Golarion on their own. Freed but without purpose, many shabti try to recreate the lives that they think they were supposed to lead, replaying out the themes and situations from false memories that fill their heads. Others find themselves tormented for ages by the fact they were solely created to endure punishment for sins committed by another. Some shabti revel in the freedom of their new endless existence, traveling the world in search of sensation and meaning. A rare few shabti find purpose in aiding Pharasma. They seek to do justice in the god's name and preserve the natural order. Some follow this path as repayment for being freed, while others want to ensure that others don't suffer in their creators' stead.",Shabti,4

Most stand as tall and long as house cats and have charcoal-colored scales and membranous wings just translucent enough to pass for shadows. Attracted to shiny materials, they employ deception, teamwork, and even rudimentary traps to create opportunities to make off with ill-gotten gains. Shadow drakes have a particular fascination and admiration for umbral dragons—a notable exception to the norm for drakes and dragons.",Drake,2
Shadow Giant,"Shadow giants are fierce natives of the Shadow Plane, where they have dwelled in perpetual twilight for millennia. Their cultures vary greatly depending on whether the giants reside in their land of origin or have relocated to the Material Plane. On the Shadow Plane, they live in familiar groups and uphold a nomadic way of life as they roam across ancestral lands between shadowy forests and misty chasms. These hunter-gatherers pass down lore through oral histories, conduct pilgrimages to unholy ziggurats of black stone, and bathe in the blood of their long-standing foes, including rival shadow giant clans and velstracs intent on enslaving their kind. On the Material Plane, conversely, they are secretive and isolationist, keeping apart from other peoples in forbidding structures of black stone in high, isolated mountain valleys. Standing 15 feet tall, with gray skin and hair only a shade lighter, shadow giants are fearsome foes with a well-earned reputation as zealous warmongers and ruthless combatants. They rarely interact with outsiders, though they may treat with proven warriors who show the giants the respect and deference they feel they deserve. Only a small subset of shadow giants worship Zon-Kuthon, and most of these Kuthites are so firmly entrenched in the culture of Nidal that their Shadow Plane-dwelling kin would hardly recognize them. Most shadow giants instead practice an ancient religion, unique to their people, with its own bloody themes of sacrifice and self-mutilation.",Giant,13
Shadow Worm,"Shadow worms are monstrous cave worms that dwell on the Shadow Plane. Larger and more cunning than most cave worms, shadow worms are fearsome predators that leave swaths of devastation in their wake. Most have glossy, black-armored hide, but those that burrow near velstrac lands are streaked with dark red, for the blood the velstracs spill has soaked into the very stones these shadow worms consume.",Cave Worm,20
Shadow Yai,"Oni who assume the form of shadow giants are known as shadow yais. Many shadow yais crave the pleasures of music and go to great lengths to secure bardic or musically inclined supplicants. Smaller beings who refuse to submit to a shadow yai are subject to painful, drawn out, and strangely beautiful deaths, for a shadow yai has a special way of evoking melodic cries and screams from their victims: a veritable symphony of pain. Individuals of particular musical skill who accompany a shadow yai can find the experience extremely lucrative and enriching—as long as they don't run afoul of their liege.",Oni,16
Shadowforged Guardian,"Shadowforged guardians are created through the intricate and dangerous process of siphoning penumbral energies and matter from the Shadow Plane and then binding them to a physical skeleton of wood and metal. The first shadowforged guardians were created thousands of years ago in Nidal and were usually crafted in the likeness of that nation's patron deity, Zon-Kuthon. Shadowforged guardians are understandably in high demand; unfortunately, only the person who speaks a special word or phrase at the moment of the construct's creation can command it. Those who know the hidden formula to craft these constructs guard the secret well and only a few shadowcasters deign to create these guardians on another person's behalf—for a hefty price.",,10
Shae,"Shae are wispy, tenebrous creatures native to the Plane of Shadow. Their amorphous bodies appear in constant states of flux. They cast no shadows of their own, instead gaining and losing umbral energy to nearby shadows that shrink and grow alongside them. Most shae wear clothing spun from shadows that shift with them, though diplomats sometimes don more conventional garments while entertaining outsiders. Their most distinctive apparel are their white stone masks, which shae don only when they must put on a discernible “face” for interacting with humanoids and similar creatures. They do so begrudgingly, as they consider themselves superior to humanoids, but donning their masks allows them to be more easily understood and thus keeps their interactions with their lessers as brief as possible. The dynamic between a shae and humanoids shifts when humanoids come to worship a shae, however. A mortal who shows a shae their due deference is worth keeping around, so many shae collect cults of personality or expansive entourages. Even getting a meeting with such a self-important shae can present a challenge that requires one to deal with many layers of hangers-on who insist on vetting the newcomer before wasting the shae's precious time. According to shae lore, they've transcended the material world and now embody a cosmological equilibrium of reality and illusion. Their claims to metaphysical ascendance and knowledge of the secrets of shadows entice many mortal supplicants to join shae courts and cults. In the shae language, their name means “unbound,” in accordance with their belief that their ephemeral nature makes them free of the moral and social strictures that bind other sentient creatures, and they essentially make a virtue of capriciousness. Shae feel little obligation to follow through with oaths or obey laws, so sealing a compact with a mortal means little to them.",,4
Shaitan,"Hailing from the Plane of Earth, shaitans are proud and brazen genies. They value physical skill and love bargaining, games of chance, and working with metal and stone. Immense gemstones and veins of precious metal crisscross their home plane, and the industrious shaitans have built a vast mercantile empire from these abundant natural resources.",Genie,7
Shambler,"Shamblers are cunning carnivorous plants that resemble heaps of wet, rotting vegetation. Even when standing erect on their stumpy legs, shamblers don’t have much in the way of identifiable anatomy; they are tangles of parasitic vines that lash out at prey with their longest creepers, entwined together to deliver powerful blows. Sometimes called “shambling mounds,” these ambush predators have a particular fondness for flesh, and are most well known for their ability to hunker down and hide in plain sight. A shambler can draw nutrients from plant matter or soil, but won’t do so if it suspects meat might soon wander near, and indeed may lie in wait for days in anticipation of such a meal. Shamblers are usually solitary creatures. Fierce thunderstorms are among the few events that bring numerous shamblers together. During such gatherings, the plants gather around strange but seemingly sacred earthen mounds in remote jungles and swamps and cavort and caper excitedly, stretching their tendrils toward the sky to hope for—or perhaps to summon—intense lightning strikes. Not only are these strange plants unharmed by even the most powerful electrical strikes, but they seem to become supernaturally empowered by such bursts of raw energy. Shamblers consider being struck by lightning a sign of divine favor, and those shamblers frequently blasted by bolts of electricity become respected (and powerful) elders among their kind. Shambler elders are few and far between and may possess a wide array of abilities; some can cast primal spells, others can empathically call upon the aid of other shamblers in the area, and still others wield awesome powers over electricity. Other types of shamblers exist, including those composed not of plant matter but fungal growth. These creatures, known as “spore mounds,” discharge clouds of toxic spores from their bodies when struck in combat. In semiarid deserts, shambler-like plants called tanglethorns dwell amid sagebrush and rock formations; they resemble bunches of tumbleweeds and cacti and in  ict deep, bloody lacerations with their attacks.",,6

Shanrigol Behemoth,"Shanrigols that grow with the additions of many living victims can become truly enormous in size and pose a greater danger in their expanding hunting territories. Subterranean communities have collapsed entire tunnels to prevent the creatures from reaching their settlements. Many shanrigol behemoths absorb enough brain matter to form crude intelligences and take a serpentine or humanoid shape. They're more varied in their abilities than shanrigol heaps, as they often gain abilities from their constituent creatures. The shanrigol behemoth presented below contains flesh from driders and urdefhans, giving it a web attack and necrotic decay ability. Not all shanrigol behemoths have these two abilities, but should have other abilities to replace them.",Shanrigol,9
Shanrigol Heap,"The most basic and common type of shanrigol is called, based on its general shape, a shanrigol heap. These amalgamations of warped flesh and shattered bone establish hunting grounds by accident rather than design, remaining where prey has been plentiful in the past so they can grow larger and larger as they add to their jumbled forms. Only rare fleshwarpers create these abominations willingly, as they ignore all commands and containment to seek out prey.",Shanrigol,4
Shantak,"The imposing shantaks are far more intelligent than their bestial appearance would suggest. They can speak, though their voices sound like glass grinding on stone, and they can't converse in any language besides Aklo. Shantaks' ability to travel through the gulfs of outer space at supernatural speed allows them to nest on numerous worlds, yet despite this mobility, most shantaks are reluctant to seek out new homes unless faced with no other option. Instead, they roost in discarded ruins or asteroids adrift in space, only emerging and landing upon planets in their chosen stellar system when the urge to feed compels them. Despite not being native to the Dimension of Dreams, they're commonly found in that realm. Their ability to fly through space affords them swift travel between Leng and more hospitable reaches of the Dreamlands, making them particularly sought after as mounts for those who have business in the far reaches of the dreaming plane. Convincing a shantak to become a mount is notoriously difficult. They refuse any sort of training, and even if one is convinced to ferry a humanoid on their back, they can be obstinate and fickle. Anyone relying on a shantak mount should have a backup plan ready in case the shantak strands their passenger on an asteroid or strange planet after some disagreement. Although a shantak is nearly the size of an elephant, many possess irrational fears of certain creatures. In particular, nightgaunts terrify them, but other shantaks have been observed fleeing from harpies and gargoyles. Though these ancestries all share the same trait, shantaks don't fear every type of winged humanoid, which makes the origin of their phobia all the more mysterious. Shantaks on Golarion typically hide themselves away in remote places since several of the creatures they fear appear on the planet in abundance.",,8
Shatterling,"Shatterlings have a fixation on mirrors that gives them a strange affinity for reflective surfaces. These creeping, wicked fey stand barely 3 feet high and look like hunched humanoids made of shifting panes of jagged mirror glass. Shatterlings usually inhabit areas with plenty of mirrors, like carnival fun houses, opulent manors, or playhouses. Capricious and malevolent, shatterlings quickly kill or scare away anyone else in such areas, as they desire to be the only ones to gaze into the mirrors they claim as their own.",,14
Shaukeen,"Perhaps the most perverse asuras of them all, shaukeens particularly delight in causing the downfall of those who give them succor, shelter, and most of all, schooling. Many a teacher has come across a shaukeen disguised as a small child of exceptional talents or curiosity and taken them under their wing, only to be beguiled into ruin. This diminutive asura's cleverness is disproportionate to their size; they ask probing questions and coax their prey into decisions that lead to heresy, furthering the collapse of order and decency. When the world turns on the shaukeen's mentor, the asura is gone—but not very far, for they love hiding unseen and watching the torment and destruction of their mentors.",Asura,1
Shemhazian,"Shemhazians rise from the souls of torturers and those who reveled in mutilating the physical bodies of their victims. Standing 35 feet tall, a shemhazian is well equipped with a wide range of talons, claws, and fangs to continue inflicting such torments on those it encounters. Shemhazians delight in visiting torment upon mortals, of course, but more than most demons, these fiends revel in sharing the pain with their own kind. Other demons fear and hate shemhazians for this reason, with only the most powerful willing to work with a shemhazian to achieve a shared goal. Even then, the shemhazian is always on the watch for an opportunity to bring pain and suffering to its allies along with any foe.",Demon,16
Shield Archon,"Shield archons defend the fortresses of Heaven against fiendish incursions. They wield their spears and shields in massive formations capable of withstanding any onslaught.

Given their tremendous strength and imposing stature, shield archons are ideal guardians of the meek and are sometimes summoned to the Material Plane to ward off the attacks of great numbers of evildoers.",Archon,10
Shikigami,"Shikigami are the least powerful of all kami and the most common. Unlike most other kami, which are bound to their wards by a more powerful spirit or deity, shikigami are minor spirits that even mortal practitioners can sometimes bind into a tiny paper form and task with guarding small works, such as garden statues and vases. Landowners delight in having shikigami protect their gardens, whether they paid a wandering spellcaster to entreat the shikigami or simply had the fortune of another spirit assigning a shikigami to their land. Travelers who come across a shikigami-graced milestone or waypost believe that such encounters are good omens for the journey ahead. For their part, shikigami have mixed opinions on civilization and the humanoids who dwell therein. While shikigami will fight to protect their ward against invaders and desecrators, these kami are just as likely to leave—their ward in tow—if locals begin to despoil the area or show a disregard for nature. Most practitioners capable of binding a shikigami wouldn't engage in this type of disrespect, but should the kami catch wind of such practices, shikigami across the land might abandon their contracts en masse, leaving an uncomfortable vacuum with their unexpected exodus. In this way, shikigami exemplify the precarious balance between the expansion of civilization and the preservation of the natural world. Not all shikigami protect gardens, so you can substitute the shikigami's spade for any sort of mundane tool that's useful to the shikigami's task and their ward. The kami wields any such weapon with the same damage dice, modifiers, and traits listed for their spade Strike, but change the damage type as appropriate for the new weapon.",Kami,1
Shimmernewt,"Native to the coastal provinces of eastern Holomog, these strange amphibians have frilled, iridescent gills that appear asymmetrically on either side of their bodies. Random arrays of spots, stripes, and other patterns decorate their flanks, and it's said no two shimmernewts have the same coloration. Originally, shimmernewts were ordinary (if oversized) amphibians, living their lives between brackish coastal lakes or tidal pools and the steamy jungles nearby. Over time, the ambient chaotic energies flowing through Holomog magically altered their evolution. The shimmernewts of today barely resemble their ancestors. Their inherent chaotic nature has resulted in shimmernewts operating on different cycles from one another. Some are diurnal, some are nocturnal, but most are crepuscular. Shimmernewts that live close to peaceful humanoid settlements are often docile, but wild populations, whether deep in the jungle or in proximity to more violent settlements, can be quite aggressive. When provoked, all shimmernewts can inflate their gills in impressive displays to appear more attractive to mates or more intimidating to rivals. The capricious amphibians lack any natural predators, and conservation-minded locals are trying to prevent them from migrating further inland. Some underground rings host shimmernewt fights, an unsavory form of entertainment made alluring by lucrative betting. Strolling down the docks of any port town in Holomog for a few minutes provokes whispered invitations to these fights. Though many locals decry these fights as inhumane, each time a ring is shut down, another group pops up sooner or later.",,6
Shining Child,"Shining children are wicked, enigmatic monsters that roam remote planes and untraveled corners of the universe in search of esoteric lore. With their abnormally gaunt frames, long white hair, and unnerving, four-fingered hands, shining children are both strangely familiar and otherworldly in appearance, though they are barely visible within the shroud of blinding light they continually emit. Their faces are truly horrible, however, as their overlarge eyes and distended, gaping mouths reveal their heads to be voids filled with unnatural light. Shining children use this light as a weapon, weaving illusions and focusing beams of fiery brilliance. Because of their reputation as scholars of the alien and the eldritch, shining children are sometimes summoned by powerful wizards or occultists in search of rare knowledge. The creatures never give away their lore without some price, though, and typically demand in return the performance of contemptible deeds that further their inscrutable, far-ranging plans. These mysterious beings are natives of the Astral Plane. In that vast plane, accretions of metaphysical matter gradually accumulate and eventually coalesce into demiplanes. During this tumultuous process, sparks of living light sometimes shear off the newly formed planes, and these sparks of raw planar energy somehow transform into shining children. Every newly formed demiplane leaves a different mental imprint on its shining “offspring,” making it easy for shining children to telepathically recognize their brothers and sisters. Forever trapped in apparently adolescent bodies, shining children dedicate themselves to scholarship and violence with equal measure in a futile effort to understand their roles in the multiverse and the burning injustice of their births. Shining children confuse most other creatures with their refusal to use individual names in favor of alternating between referring to each other singularly and collectively.",,12

Shoal Linnorm,"Shoal linnorms occupy rocky shoreline shallows and slither along lonely coastlines. While they do not intentionally seek out large settlements, these linnorms nonetheless beleaguer fishers headed out from small coastal towns, and they may even follow skiffs back to their home port to appraise the town's defenses and plan a raid. Shoal linnorms tend to hunt large prey, both underwater and on land. Their preferred quarries includes giant squid and grizzly bears—meals rich in fat, which the linnorms metabolize into the fiery steam that courses through their veins.",Linnorm,15
Shobhad Enforcer,"In rough Akitonian cities like Seldo, shobhad bruisers and fist-fighters act as protection for businesses and enforcers for crime bosses. Shobhad enforcers are more rare and far more dangerous. In the wilds of Akiton, shobhad enforcers protect wealthy caravans using combat techniques honed and proven over multiple generations to devastate any creature that might mistake the caravan as an attractive target for a raid. “Enforcer” is a loose translation of a word in the Shobhad language that is only granted to a warrior who has proven themselves in combat against one of the deadly threats of the Akitonian desert, such as gluttonworms or ikeshti riveners. Every enforcer is a battle-tested veteran with the scars to prove their prowess.",Shobhad,16
Shobhad Sniper,"Enemies rarely see a shobhad sniper before the deadly blast of their powerful rifles snatches away the offender's life. Selected from among the most talented enforcers after proving themselves in combat, shobhad snipers learn how to cross the desert sands undetected, combine their powerful ranged weapons with close-combat techniques, and survive Akiton's freezing nights for weeks on end while scouting potential settlements or enemy strongholds.",Shobhad,17
Shock Zombie,"Shock zombies are hideous undead covered with bolts and electrical wiring. Most have two large electric coils mounted on their backs to absorb and project electricity. If uncontrolled, shock zombies often wander far afield in search of inventors' labs or lightning storms to draw power from. In a pinch, the natural electric currents inside living creatures more than suffice. Zombie Abilities You can modify shock zombies with the following zombie abilities, in addition to those available to all zombies. Most shock zombies have one of these abilities; if you give a shock zombie more, you might want to increase its level and adjust its statistics. Arcing Strikes (electricity) When a shock zombie hits a creature with a melee attack, an arc of lighting leaps to a second creature, dealing 1d12 electricity damage. This secondary target must be within 10 feet of the shock zombie's original target and must be the creature closest to the original target (if multiple creatures are equidistant, the shock zombie chooses which to affect). Breath Weapon  [two-actions]  (electricity, evocation) The shock zombie breathes lightning, dealing 4d12 electricity damage in a 40-foot line (DC 24 basic Reflex save). It can't use its Breath Weapon again for 1 minute. Electromechanical Phasing  [two-actions]  (electricity) Frequency once per day; Effect The shock zombie activates its electromechanical components and begins phasing in and out of reality. The shock zombie casts blink as a 4th-level divine innate spell. Lightning Rod  [reaction]  (electricity) Trigger A spell or ability with the electricity trait is used within 30 feet of the shock zombie; Effect The shock zombie attempts to counteract the spell or ability (counteract level 3, counteract modifier +17), harmlessly redirecting the electricity into one of its electricity coils.",Zombie,6
Shocker Lizard,"These brightly colored reptiles share the rough size and pack mentality of guard dogs, roaming in small groups. Shocker lizards have specialized glands under their scales that accumulate static electricity, and they can unleash blasts of lightning strong enough to harm significantly larger foes. Though they're meek and docile when encountered alone, shocker lizards are significantly more aggressive in packs, when they can amplify each other's electrical attacks. Shocker lizards are notoriously difficult to domesticate because they're dangerously hostile as part of a pack, but will also swiftly wither and die if kept alone in captivity without constant attention. A shocker lizard is 3 feet long and weighs 25 pounds.",,2
Shoggoth,"Although even raving fanatics and doom-saying prophets desperately claim the monstrous shoggoth is nothing more than a drug-induced vision or a thankfully unreal nightmare, the truth is altogether more dire. Shoggoths exist, yet they tend keep to the deepest of ocean trenches or the most remote of caverns and ruins, emerging to spread chaos and destruction in their slimy wakes. The first shoggoths were created by an alien species to serve as mindless beasts of burden. Their vast bulk, incredible strength, and amorphous nature made them useful slave labor, and their ability to spontaneously form whatever new eyes, mouths, limbs, and other organs they might need made them incredibly versatile. Eventually, the shoggoths developed enough intelligence to rebel against their masters, and now they lurk, patient but potent, in the lightless deeps. A shoggoth has goals and methods unknowable to humanoid beings. They remember their eons of servitude and, compared to their mysterious masters, humans, elves, dwarves and other intelligent beings are mere specks which crawl upon the surface of the world, indistinguishable from animals. When a shoggoth rolls its immense, hideous body over a band of explorers, engulfing them in a gelatinous press of flesh and gnawing teeth, it is not so much evil as uncaring. Shoggoths can become the object of worship for humanoid cults dedicated to chaos and entropy. The shoggoth does not respond to this worship, but it can be counted on to consume any hapless victim the cult can capture and sacrifice to it. Rumors of shoggoths that have developed even greater intellects are, one would hope, just that, for the damage a shoggoth capable of reasoning could wreak upon a world is unsettling to say the least.",,18
Shoggti,"Shoggti travel to other planes in roving bands to capture and charm victims, bringing them back to the Abyss where they are enslaved for unknown—but no doubt insidiously evil—purposes. These squid-like qlippoth have slick, blue skin and four suckered tentacles that end in dexterous pincers. In addition to a lamprey-like mouth at the base of its body, each has a secondary maw in the middle of its forehead that stretches from between its two bulging eyes to the back of its head.",Qlippoth,7
Shoki,Shokis are shepherds who lead wayward souls to the Boneyard.,Psychopomp,9
Shoony Hierarch,"For all their advancement in agriculture, horticulture, and animal husbandry, shoonies subscribe to a remarkably antiquated form of leadership; the role of hierarch is normally inherited, passed on to the oldest living child of the village’s previous hierarch. In the instance that the village’s hierarch does not produce an heir, the village holds a general election. Elected hierarchs hold the term for life and are just as highly regarded as hierarchs raised from birth. When the settlement comes under attack, it is up to the hierarch to decide when to fight and when to flee. In most cases, shoonies prefer to elect individuals with a preference toward the latter.",Shoony,4
Shoony Militia Member,"If shoonies had their way, war would cease to exist altogether, but they know this isn’t likely. Shoonies’ relative wealth of resources and their frailty compared to other humanoids make them a common target of violence and subjugation. Because of this, basic combat training is typically mandatory for all shoony village members. Few individuals pursue lifelong careers in service to their settlement’s militia, however. The passing down of a sword from one shoony soldier to another is a time-honored tradition, owing to the rarity of weapons in shoony society.",Shoony,2
Shoony Tiller,"Nearly all shoonies in a given settlement are farmers, fishers, or foragers. Shoonies are not expected to fight to protect their settlements; most agree it is better to live in cowardice than to die with that foolish, intangible principle taller races call “honor.” Many shoonies hone their skill with tools rather than arms in the knowledge that whatever is lost to violence can be rebuilt. When cornered, a shoony may put up a fight with whatever they have on hand; the average shoony can wield a simple shovel or pick in melee as well as most humans can wield a sword.",Shoony,0
Shredskin,"Shredskins are flying, flapping animate skins who wander the lands lamenting their fate and feeling hollow and adrift, as if they're missing something crucial inside them. They try to enshroud and seize humanoid bodies—either corpses or living creatures, anything to fill that void within themselves. Though many will take any body they can overpower, some know who created them and desire only that body to claim as their own, the truest fulfillment of their accursed nature. Shredskins come from people skinned as inhumane trophies, or who were killed in a gruesome way that left only their skin intact, such as being pulled into a machine and degloved.",,2
Shrine Skelm,"The unquestioned authority that a priest wields, with influence over even the most intimate details of a congregation's lives, is the ultimate prize for a shrine skelm. Most shrine skelms insinuate themselves into positions of judgment in powerful religious groups to gain that power for their own use and abuse. Shrine skelms wear the old-fashioned, traditional apparel of whatever faith they've infiltrated, brandishing religious symbols made of precious metals to better blend in and give an impression of age and power. No matter what religion they infiltrate, a shrine skelm is a master at taking established teachings out of context to justify elaborate, painful, and often humiliating punishments for his victims. He usually targets people with the audacity to question his position or teachings, but also relentlessly harasses anyone he envies. Shrine skelms are skilled listeners, especially in settings like group prayers where they can learn worshippers' fears or hopes. They exploit whatever information they learn for their own prestige and power, but they also watch for jealousy and the seeds of rage that could be nurtured to make a new skelm. They can even intercept sincere prayers and steal their effects for themselves, and they command several spells to manipulate and control their unwitting, vulnerable victims.",Skelm,5
Shuln,"Scourges of the upper Darklands, these enormous, mole-like monstrosities slice and burrow through solid stone with massive forearms and adamantine-strong claws. Shulns grow to about 20 feet long and have four tiny, nearly imperceptible eyes; a long, pale snout; four thick-muscled legs that end in long, serrated claws; and a stubby pink tail. As a young shuln matures, its unique metabolism produces adamantine that becomes infused throughout its skeletal system. In addition to making their claws and fangs nearly unbreakable, this unique physiological trait makes shulns unparalleled burrowers and highly sought by monster hunters who hope to harvest the precious material from their corpses. Shulns have a ravenous appetite and eat nearly anything they can catch, but their preferred diet consists almost entirely of large invertebrates, especially cave worms. They rely on tiny sensory whiskers that cover their snoutfland allow them to detect subtle movements in the air and ground without the use of vision. When it detects suitable prey, a shuln bites the target at the first opportunity, injecting it with a potent paralytic toxin present in its saliva. So strong is this poison that it is capable of subduing even the near-unstoppable purple worm, making the shuln a valuable (if dangerous) companion to have for anyone making excursions into worm-infested regions of the Darklands. Shulns’ notoriously ill-tempered dispositions and their knack for digging into areas of an underground settlement where digging ought not occur makes them frustrating creatures to keep around, but when the alternative is an unpredictable but deadly visit from an enormous, hungry cave worm, the annoyances are well worth the trouble. Encounters with much larger shuln-like entities on the Plane of Earth suggest that these creatures may have originated from that place. The larger shulns still retain their elemental qualities, are quite a bit smarter, and have their own suite of earth-themed innate primal spells—but for all that, they still love the taste of cave worm.",,12
Shulsaga,"Shepherds of the Silver Sea, shulsagas patrol the Astral Plane to protect the nascent demiplanes that form there, warding off those who would usurp the demiplanes or despoil them with unwelcome philosophies. This guardianship extends to the Astral Plane as a whole, as shulsagas not only exile trespassers, but also seek out and close planar rifts. Especially egregious breaches rile these ennosites to the point of invasion, and shulsaga raiding parties often extend their attacks well beyond a portal to ensure the threat's utter destruction. Though often stern and standoffish, shulsagas occasionally befriend and recruit strangers to help them repair planar wounds and track down foes of the natural order. Among ennosites, shulsagas are the most inclined to adopt and nurture iotons, forming small family units. Communities work together to instill enough culture and identity for these iotons to take on permanent forms—those of adolescent shulsagas. Each shulsaga's gender reflects of their evolving identity, influenced in part by the blend of traits their communities imparted and their own thoughts.",Ennosite,3

Siege Shard,"Sieges provoke lingering feelings of confinement and desperation. These emotions can coalesce as a psychic presence that animates broken battlements as quasi-intelligent constructs dubbed siege shards. The shard's surface depicts the conflicts that created it, which hold the key to dispersing its psychic presence. A successful DC 18 check to Recall Knowledge is sufficient to identify the conflict that engendered the construct. A creature aware of a shard's generative conflict can attempt the following activity.Prove Peace  [two-actions] Concentrate&nbsp;Manipulate&nbsp;Source Pathfinder #157: Devil at the Dreaming Palace pg. 84Requirements You know the conflict that created a specific siege shard, and the siege shard is immobilized.You touch the siege shard, establish a mental connection, and relay facts of the conflict's resolution. Attempt a check to Recall Knowledge about the conflict that created the shard, using the siege shard's Will DC. If you succeed, you prove the conflict's end, and the siege shard reverts to ordinary stone. On a critical failure, images of the past conflict overwhelm you, and you are confused until the end of your next turn.",,3
Sigbin,"Resembling hornless goats with extremely long tails, sigbins live in forests and prey on inhabitants of nearby humanoid villages. Sigbins drink the blood of their victims by biting into their shadows, rather than their flesh. This process typically leaves the victim so fatigued that they must lie down to rest, at which point the sigbin finishes the job by sinking their jaws into the person's chest and consuming their heart. Due to their nauseating smell, many sigbins hide among livestock and in other overwhelmingly odorous places. Sigbins have the ability to hide in plain sight simply by standing stock still, but this power works only against adults and elders; for whatever reason, children and young animals can see the invisible sigbins. Many believe this is because children are unsullied by the cruel ways of the world, and so their eyes are still innocent enough to spot the devious beasts. Unfortunately, most adults tend to ignore children's cries about the monsters, chalking up such claims to overactive imaginations or attention-seeking behavior, inadvertently allowing sigbins to continue their hunts uninterrupted.",,5
Silent Stalker,"When a person is betrayed and killed in a way that their voice was silenced (such as through strangulation by a lover or close confidante), they might come back as a silent stalker. A silent stalker is a horrifying, twisted likeness of the person they were in life, with one obvious difference: the silent stalker has no mouth, simply a smooth patch of flesh where a mouth should be. Sound is suppressed in an area around a silent stalker, but once someone notices the quiet, it's often too late.",Revenant,13
Silvanshee,"Silvanshees are a stealthy and extremely inquisitive contingent of agathions who gather information about the mortal world for other agathions. While they love to explore the Material Plane and sate their curiosity, they're generally reclusive and skittish. These dual instincts war with each other whenever something exciting piques their interest. Because of their small sizes, they don't pose a combat threat to most creatures; instead, silvanshees act as Nirvana's eyes and ears in the mortal world, reporting back to superiors or calling for help should they run into danger. Silvanshees appear indistinguishable from domestic felines, save for their violet eyes and the telltale blaze of differently colored fur on their chests. Of course, flying gives them away outright, so if at all possible, they only do so while in trusted company to avoid detection. Their fur color runs the spectrum of normal feline colorations. They can also transform into mist when necessary to maintain discretion or make a hasty getaway.",Agathion,1

Simurgh,"Desert-dwelling people consider the sight of a simurgh a herald to a lifetime’s worth of luck, and those who are unfamiliar with the majestic beast might mistake it for the avatar of a deity. Beautiful, graceful, and truly gargantuan, the simurgh resembles nothing so much as a massive multicolored bird with the head of an equally enormous and regal lupine. Simurghs act as intermediaries in world-threatening conflicts, serving as agents of good deities or vigilantes who spread their own brand of justice, typically by obliterating or banishing evil extraplanar beings. Simurghs can live for thousands of years, and because these ancient beings are so rare many doubt their existence. But they are very real, as those who have been aided by a simurgh can enthusiastically attest. A simurgh does not show itself often, but when it does, it is typically in response to a truly grave threat, such as the incursion of an undead army or the rampage of some truly epic monster. Simurghs are nothing if not paragons of righteousness, and goodly heroes can hardly find a better ally in their quest to vanquish evil than a simurgh.",,18
Sinspawn,"Sinspawn were created by one of seven ancient wizards known collectively as runelords—each of whom embraced and embodied one of seven sins. The first sinspawn was created by the Runelord of Wrath, utilizing techniques that have since gone on to influence fleshwarping practices. It wasn’t long before the technique used to create sinspawn fell into the hands of the other runelords, and while each tried their own hand at crafting variants of their own design, today sinspawn of wrath remain the most numerous and notorious of their kind. Bearing only a vague resemblance to the humanoids from whose flesh they were formed, sinspawn generally appear horrifically emaciated and have unnaturally long arms and digitigrade legs, each with a trio of stubby, taloned digits. Veins bulge across sinspawn’s bodies in sanguine patterns that suspiciously resemble twisted runes, and their flesh is pale and hairless. Their heads are elongated, bearing only slits for a nose, red eyes, and disturbing lower jaws that split in half at the chin, revealing pedipalps that end in tiny, three-fingered hands and framing a long, lolling tongue. Sinspawn stand 6-1/2 feet tall and typically weigh as much as an emaciated human of their size. They behave in a manner consistent with their associated sin and have physical characteristics that hint at these qualities. For example, greedspawn’s veins appear to run with gold while envyspawn appear even more wasted than the rest of their kin.Sinspawn Sins When a sinspawn is created, it becomes associated with one of the seven sins: envy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, sloth, or wrath. A sinspawn’s sin is determined by the runewell that spawned it or by its creator’s preferred sin, and cannot be changed. Each sin grants sinspawn associated with it additional benefits and abilities beyond those described by the sinspawn stat block, as detailed below.Envyspawn An envyspawn has Deception +7 and typically carries a halberd. They tend to be shorter and thinner than other sinspawn. Melee  [one-action]  halberd +10 (reach 10 feet, versatile S), Damage 1d10+4 piercing Sinful Bite Creatures that critically fail their saves against an envyspawn’s sinful bite are enfeebled 2 for 1 minute. Gluttonyspawn A gluttonyspawn has Survival +10 and usually carries a scythe. They are obese, but hardy and strong. Melee  [one-action]  scythe +10 (deadly d10, trip), Damage 1d10+4 slashing Sinful Bite Creatures that critically fail their saves against a gluttonyspawn’s sinful bite are drained 1. Greedspawn A greedspawn has Thievery +9 and typically wields a glaive. They are the tallest of sinspawn, often 7 feet in height, and with gold-tinged veins. Melee  [one-action]  glaive +10 (deadly d8, forceful, reach 10 feet), Damage 1d8+4 slashing Sinful Bite Creatures that critically fail their saves against a greedspawn’s sinful bite are clumsy 2 for 1 minute. Lustspawn A lustspawn has Diplomacy +7 and usually carries a guisarme. They have attractive bodies, but hideous faces. Melee  [one-action]  guisarme +10 (reach 10 feet, trip), Damage 1d10+4 slashing Sinful Bite Creatures that critically fail their saves against a lustspawn’s sinful bite are stupefied 2 for 1 minute. Pridespawn A pridespawn has Intimidation +7 and often wields a maul. They are nearly skeletal in their gauntness, and often seek out fine clothes or jewelry to wear, taking strange pleasure in appearing elegant and regal. Melee  [one-action]  maul +10 (shove), Damage 1d12+4 bludgeoning Sinful Bite Creatures that critically fail their saves against a pridespawn’s sinful bite are clumsy 1 and enfeebled 1 for 1 minute. Slothspawn A slothspawn has Society +6 and usually carries a longspear. Thick rolls of excess skin drape the slothspawn’s hunched frame. Melee  [one-action]  longspear +10 (reach 10 feet), Damage 1d8+4 piercing Sinful Bite Creatures that critically fail their saves against a slothspawn’s sinful bite take a –10-foot status penalty to their Speeds for 1 minute. Wrathspawn The most commonly encountered of the sinspawn, a wrathspawn has Athletics +12 and typically wields a ranseur. These sinspawn are the bulkiest looking of their kind. Melee  [one-action]  ranseur + 10 (disarm, reach 10 feet), Damage 1d10+4 piercing Sinful Bite Creatures that critically fail their saves against a wrathspawn’s sinful bite are drained 1 as well as enfeebled 1 for 1 minute.",,2
Skaveling,"Hideous necromantic rituals give rise to skavelings, or ghoul bats, monstrosities that are not true ghouls but instead are specifically crafted undead creatures. Their creators are the bloodsucking urdefhans of the Darklands, who create skavelings from giant bats specially raised on diets of toxic fungus and the flesh of ghouls—especially brains harvested from these undead. Upon reaching maturity, these giant bats are ritually slain via the use of cytillesh oil. While this poison simply rots away the flesh of most creatures, one of these specially prepared bats will immediately rise from death as a skaveling after succumbing to its effects. Despite its tattered wings and sagging skin, a skaveling is more than capable of flight, even when carrying a creature mounted on its back—urdefhans often use skavelings as mounts in this way. Their intelligence is more advanced than that of the typical giant bat, and in combat they function more as allies than as mere mounts, capable of making their own tactical decisions. Yet even though they can reason and think, skavelings remain loyal to the urdefhans who created them, and they never take actions in a fight that would knowingly put their masters in harm's way.",,5

Skilled practitioners see this as a waste of a powerful body and imbue them with air walking magic based on those of titans, while the wise know it's nearly impossible to control such a colossus and that it's just as likely to crush its creator underneath its mighty foot as it is to smite their foes.",Skeleton,13

Skinstitch,"Skinstitches' hulking frames are made from flayed humanoid skin stuffed with straw and poisonous insects. The dark god Norgorber grants the secrets for creating these monstrosities in disturbing dreams he sends to select adherents, in which the dreamer imagines themself skinning a beloved pet, friend, or family member. Those that accept these teachings become skinstitchers. The creation of a skinstitch is a crude process compared to the making of a more advanced construct like a golem. Rough stitching, imprecise shapes, and shoddy materials give a skinstitch its patchwork appearance. While most skinstitches have vaguely humanoid shapes, they often appear monstrous due to various modifications their creators have made to their bodies. Some skinstitches' arms, for instance, might bear jagged metal blades or blunt iron rods. The most talented skinstitchers rarely bother with the humanoid form at all and instead opt to craft skinstitches that resemble other creatures sacred to Norgorber, such as scorpions, centipedes, or spiders. Rumors lurk of skinstitchers who can use exotic materials like steel, daemon flesh, or even magical shadows for their creations. The rotting materials used to build skinstitches tend to attract vermin, which can in turn form a hive or nest within the creations' bodies. Skinstitchers consider the presence of such tenants to be a sure sign of Norgorber's approval.",,5
Skrik Nettle,"The expansive skies of the First World are home to skrik nettles—delicate, bizarre-looking creatures that resemble large jellyfishes. A fringe of brightly colored feathers circles their bodies, and long tendrils trail from their center, each ending in a snapping beak. Known for their eerie, chirping melodies, skrik nettles soar above the First World in flocks of a dozen or more, diligently scavenging for food in the fey realm's cutthroat ecosystem. When hunting or provoked, skrik nettles attack their foes by injecting them with a magical poison that causes the victim to float helplessly up into the sky. Skrik nettles continuously inject this poison into their helpless prey until it dies or is so high up that the skrik nettle needs only wait for the poison to end, its meal crashing helplessly to the ground below. Skrik nettles that find their way to the Material Plane (or any plane other than the First World, for that matter) tend to be much more aggressive, for the planar energies that they find comforting and soothing on the First World are conspicuously absent. The first few minutes after a skrik nettle arrives on any plane but the First World tend to be filled with violence and fear, as the panicking creature lashes out at any nearby creatures (including other skrik nettles) in the mistaken notion that these others are somehow responsible for the discomforting change. After 10 minutes or so, assuming the skrik nettle survives its bout of violence, the creature calms down somewhat and does its best to acclimate to its new home. Yet even skrik nettles who find themselves marooned beyond the First World for years never lose their longing for home, and they instinctively seek out portals to this plane for the rest of their lives.",,6
Skulk,"The cowardly and lazy skulks live on the fringes of organized societies and steal from others without a second thought. Even murder is merely another necessity, and they think nothing of creeping into a house, dispatching the residents, and taking what they want. Their chameleon-like ability to blend into their surroundings makes skulks difficult to detect, so their ever-present populations around the periphery of large settlements are nearly impossible to dislodge permanently. They typically travel in small groups of no more than 16 individuals, since groups larger than that tend to break into violence directed at one other. While skulks see themselves as sharing a common history of being cast out and hated, this is not a strong enough bond to hold large groups of the creatures together with a shared purpose for very long. Entrances and exits from cities, especially less-guarded access ways around sewers and the like, are skulks' favorite stomping grounds. These sites allow them to closely observe who comes and goes from the city while also affording them swift escape options, should the authorities uncover their presence. On rare occasions, a well-disciplined skulk can rise to prominence within the local thieves' guild and become sought after for difficult jobs. Their repugnant personalities and overwhelming selfishness, however, usually means they are unable to secure long-lasting leadership roles. A typical skulk is 6 feet tall with similar body structure to a gangly human. Skulks mature quickly and can live up to 50 years, although most meet a violent end long before then. The rare skulk who manages to escape their society of violence and craven bitterness can be of any alignment, but those skulks who remain bound by their traditions always see these self-imposed exiles as the worst kind of traitors, and the exiles are often targeted for eradication to the exclusion of all other victims. More than one band of skulks has accidentally engineered its own doom after throwing caution to the wind and exposing its existence to the authorities in an ill-planned but violently passionate attempt to track down such an exile.",,1
Skull Fairy,"Skull fairies are malicious beings spawned from the heads of those who die after exposure to the malignant energies of the Shadow Plane. They aren't fey, but their petite, winged forms and tendency for malevolent mischief has caused the appellation “skull fairy” to stick. After bursting from the skull of the deceased, a skull fairy seeks out victims to behead. Skull fairies enjoy nothing more than the horrific sound of wrenching a head free from a body. They often wear the skulls of their most recent victim like caps atop their bulbous, oversized heads. Skull fairies take heads they've acquired to isolated caves, where they carefully strip off the flesh and put the skulls on display. If the skull fairy feels the need for new headgear, they hollow out a fresh skull to wear and retire the old one to a place of prominence. A group of exactly three skull fairies who have each been alive for at least 13 years become much more powerful than their solitary or younger kin. Members of such a coven become stronger and more intelligent, and they set their minds to evil and chaos on a much wider scale—although anything more complicated than wandering about to twist off heads might seem aspirational to a skull fairy. Skull fairies that join a coven gain the elite adjustments and often acquire more powerful innate spells. Nondetection and stinking cloud are the most common spells a skull fairy coven can access, but others exist. A skull fairy can only join a coven consisting exclusively of other skull fairies",,3
Skull Peeler,"Skull peelers, despite their ferocious and well-deserved moniker, are considered by many to be downright adorable, especially when viewed from a safe distance. Their soft, dappled brown fur helps them hide in forest canopies, and they have shimmering insectile wings and big eyes that draw in the faintest beams of light. At first glance, a skull peeler looks like a cuddly pet or a wizard's familiar. Any illusions of domesticating such a beast are quickly dismissed upon seeing how a skull peeler eats, however. Skull peelers have evolved to hang motionlessly in treetop canopies as they wait until appropriate prey appears, usually long-necked dinosaurs but also brachiating primates and large birds. The skull peeler then lashes out with its long tongue, severing the creature's head from its body and pulling the detached cranium back into its hungry paws. It then uses its claws to crack open the cranial cavity—hence its name—before lapping up the tasty insides. Despite skull peelers' gruesome eating habits, some enterprises and individuals can't resist the urge to add these beasts to their menageries. Fey and other creatures with ties to the First World, such as gnomes, can occasionally coax a skull peeler into a form of domestication. While the adorable beasts can never be fully tamed due to their hyper-evolved hunting instincts, they can be bribed with food and, if kept satiated, displayed on a perch or indoor terrarium as an example of their master's cunning and deadliness. As often as not, these pseudo-domesticated skull peelers end up devouring a guest, pet, or their would-be owner, but this possibility doesn't stop up-and-coming crime lords from attempting to domesticate the little predators. Skull peelers kept in well-managed zoos fare somewhat better, but these clever creatures don't always stay in their cages, which has led to wild skull peelers in places travelers might not expect.",,6
Skulltaker,"Swirling down from misty peaks and through howling mountain passes like an evil wind, the vortex of bones known as a skulltaker is a terrible manifestation of the delirium and agony experienced by doomed climbers and lost trailblazers just before they met their end.

Skum,"The most numerous of the alghollthus are the ulat-kinis, a servitor race created from human stock to serve as rank-and-file soldiers in alghollthu armies. At the zenith of alghollthu power, ulat-kinis formed massive legions and enjoyed significant power over other species. When the alghollthus retreated from the world, they abandoned teeming hordes of ulatkinis. Although these erstwhile soldiers tried to continue their conquering ways, their numbers declined rapidly in battlefield defeats and purposeful exterminations enacted by their enemies. Ulat-kini society degenerated, so that now only a few enclaves exist in the depths of the earth or along isolated coastlines. Few remember their own species’ name, instead using the epithet their foes gave them: “skum.”",Alghollthu,2

Skymetal Striker,"A skymetal striker resembles a serpent—or, more precisely, the two-headed serpent known as an amphisbaena—made of a long string of dozens of spinning, sharp-toothed circular saw blades. These blades array themselves along the creature's body like beads on an invisible cord of magnetic force. Although the blades making up the creature are typically composed of many different metals and alloys, it is best known, feared, and named for the blades of orichalcum and inubrix that form the “heads” at either end of its serpentine body.","Elemental, Metal",7
Slana,"The rolling thunder before the rain provides the massive, leonine humanoids known as slanas with a tremendous power. These solitary and nomadic creatures primarily dwell in the jungles and savannas of the Mwangi Expanse, but they can range into nearby areas in search of prey or when drawn by strange primal forces only slanas can recognize. Slanas view each other as rivals who test each other's prowess, so when drawn together by this strange calling they nearly always fight to the death. A slana's roar echoes like thunder across the countryside, and denizens of the Mwangi fear a slana's approach whenever an oncoming storm's thunder seems more ferocious than its rain.",,20
Slime Mold,"A slime mold appears as a mound of earth and detritus covered in a thick layer of fungus that exudes a faint stink of decay. The fungus actually shares a symbiotic relationship with the slime mold, serving as an external digestive system while gaining access to the nutrients it needs. The ooze remains perfectly still until living prey passes within reach, then it lashes out with disgusting pseudopods. With a touch, a slime mold can infect its prey with a foul contagion known as slime rot, a horrific disease that painfully breaks down a victim's flesh. At first, the disease manifests as painful rashes and agonized joints. In the later stages, though, the flesh of the affected creature actually begins to liquefy and run in rivulets as the creature's spores continue to work. Death, when it occurs, swiftly causes the resulting body to split open and release a brand new slime mold.",Ooze,2
Slithering Pit,"A slithering pit is a strange, nearly invisible ooze with an extradimensional space for its digestive system, which mimics the appearance of an acid-filled stone pit. It slowly dissolves its captives in stomach acid until they can be digested. A slithering pit can go weeks without feeding, affording it patience. Thriving in dilapidated areas, slithering pits take up positions among the plentiful potholes where they can easily pass for just another blemish. They crawl across ramshackle cobblestone streets and damp underground complexes, waiting for unwary prey to stumble by and fall in.",,7
Sluagh Reaper,"Most sluagh are reapers: powerful killers subservient to their queen. After they collect souls on a hunt, they dutifully return their plunder to the queen. Though quite clever, they're inscrutable, lacking the whimsy and sociability that characterize many living fey. They do show merriment on occasion though, giggling as their claws draw closer to their quarry's throat.",Sluagh,10
Slug,"These massive, primeval relatives of ordinary slugs squirm slowly through swamps and grasslands. Giant slugs are always voracious and prefer to eat flesh or plants high in water content. They frequently consume livestock or strip bare entire orchards or melon crops. For cattle, pigs, or other sizable meals, they first shred the creatures using their radula—tongue-like appendages covered in teeth— to make them easier to consume. The mucus secreted by a giant slug is powerfully acidic and viscous. Wherever it travels, the creature leaves a trailing brown strip that kills most vegetation. Farmers and ranchers, especially those living near swamps known to contain giant slugs, keep close tabs on these journeys. Many almanacs go into great detail on slug migration and mating seasons. Since each giant slug needs its own wide hunting ground, the creatures typically come into proximity to mate only once a year. Either or both slugs can become impregnated, and any that do typically lay a clutch of around 100 eggs. They usually lay these eggs in a shallow bog or a cool, humid cave. Giant slugs tend to travel at night, as the creatures dislike sunlight and dry weather. They have been known to seek out locations like barns, the undersides of bridges, or even fortifications like castles for shelter as dawn starts to break. Woe to the unprepared farmer who ambles out at sunrise to milk the cows but instead finds that a giant slug has made the barn its home! Subterranean giant slugs don't have to worry about sunlight, and crawl about on no schedule in particular. Narrow tunnels pose little obstacle for them, as the creatures can easily compress their bodies. These factors make their movements very unpredictable, so they pose quite a menace for underground peoples like kobolds or xulgaths.",,8
Slurk,"The slurk is a sticky, tusked frog-beast found in underground lairs and caves. It has two massive tusks, which it uses to gore prey and tangle with rival slurks. With the slurk’s natural ability to climb walls and cling effortlessly to ceilings, it can be easy for unwary cave explorers to end up on the wrong end of the beast’s formidable ivory tusks. Slurks exude two very different types of foul-smelling secretions from their pale white skin. Large pustules on the slurk’s back drip a sticky resin-like slime that quickly hardens upon exposure to air. By flexing its skin, the slurk can burst these pustules in the direction of intruders, covering its foes in sticky goo and severely limiting their ability to withstand the monster’s other attacks, including the effects of its other secretion. Glands along the slurk’s ventral side excrete an incredibly slippery and fetid grease, which protects the slurk from the immobilizing effects of its own back slime but also has the added benefit of making it extremely difficult to grapple and capture. The best way to discover if a slurk is in the vicinity is to look for hard clumps of such grease, which accumulate and dry in cave corners and amid rock piles where the slurk rests between meals. Slurks are thought to be descendants of a failed dwarven attempt to domesticate and breed large subterranean frogs as food and labor animals. Despite this apparent failure, slurks are often befriended by others who live underground. The sticky frog-beasts have proven extremely desirable to kobolds, who now domesticate and train slurks as powerful mounts and guardians. While other creatures, particularly boggards, sometimes train slurks to serve as guardians, kobolds remain those who use these creatures the most. A kobold mounted on a slurk will often hide in the upper ledges of a cave, using the advantages of height and surprise to harry foes with ranged attacks. Kobold riders also take advantage of the slurk’s ability to climb, and charge at their enemies from the walls of a cavern.",,2
Smilodon,"Smilodons are large saber-toothed cats, apex predators that are significantly more muscular and broader than the other species of big cats. They often kill prey with a quick stab to the throat or other vulnerable spot. The smilodon’s oversized fangs are particularly sought after as trophies.",Cat,6
Smith,"Most smaller communities have at least one smithy where locals and travelers can have horses shod or equipment repaired. Larger settlements and cities often have a variety of smiths, many specializing in blacksmithing, weapon smithing, armor smithing, or even smelting coins in a mint. The smith is a 6th-level challenge when competing with smithing or other crafting tasks.",Tradespeople,3
Smog Giant,"Corrupting magical storms and the interference of unethical gearsmiths birthed the first of the so-called smog giants. These hot-tempered behemoths all originate from a clan of unfortunate hill giants which became so attuned to their strange environment they developed unique mutations and incredibly violent dispositions. For all their physical abnormalities, it's still fair to say the violent confrontations common along the Western Ravage are the true cause of smog giants' monstrous nature. Smog giants can eat meat and bone, but they prefer diets of black powder and the raw materials that make up this alchemical concoction. Their bodies store repositories of the stuff infused with the unstable occult energies that lace their flesh, granting them the ability to “crack” these pockets of subdermal explosives when they attack, much like a tough cracking their knuckles during a fight. In this case however, the results are much more violent—especially when coupled with the large quantities of weaponized body piercings and adornments smog giants often wear.",Giant,7
Smog Wraith,"Clouds of choking fumes and toxic smog continuously shroud these potent undead. They constantly belch forth noxious vapors and find great humor in the death of creatures too weak to resist their vile fumes. These fetid vapors are so dense the corpses of a smog wraith's victims can float among them. Though it's possible to create smog wraiths through necromancy, most are the result of industrialists, inventors, and polluters who in life relished opportunities to exploit nature for profit, power, or prestige. In death, these wretched souls can rise as smog wraiths to continue their spoliation.",Wraith,9
Snapdrake,"Skilled kizidhar mages and gardeners handcraft these lovely creatures as much for their shuyookhs' aesthetic pleasure as for their protection. Creating a snapdrake requires first painstakingly constructing a frame of living wood in the shape of a drake before weaving thousands of colorful snapdragon flowers into intricate patterns to form its body and scales. Once complete, snapdrakes often serve kizidhars as a combination of guards, pets, and decorations for as long as they are well fed.","Elemental, Wood",8
Snapping Flytrap,"The snapping flytrap is a ravenous, carnivorous plant that is quick to bite at any creature that passes by. Snapping flytraps typically have two sets of tooth-edged leaves, each measuring 3 feet wide, at the end of 10-foot-long stalks.",Flytrap,3
Snapping Turtle,"Snapping turtles are freshwater reptiles with a long flexible neck, a sharp piercing beak, and a confrontational temperament that doesn't prevent some spellcasters from choosing these creatures as familiars. They weigh about 20 pounds and have shells around 18 inches in length.",Turtle,-1

Solar,"Solars are among the greatest of all angels, ranking just below empyreal lords. Many solars serve at the right hand of a deity or champion a cause that benefits an entire world. Most archangels resemble humanoids, but not all—they can adopt more unusual forms as needed. A typical solar is about 9 feet tall and weighs about 500 pounds, with a commanding voice that is impossible to ignore. Most have silvery or golden skin.Solars are legendary trackers; the most masterful of them are said to be able to follow the centuries-old passage of a pit fiend flying through the Astral Plane.",Angel,23
Solar Crow,"These enormous three-legged elementals resemble crows with flaming feathers, said to shine as bright as the sun. They nest in the smoldering Forest of Mulberry Coals, living in flocks of eight to a dozen, with ten being the most common.","Elemental, Fire",10
Sootsoldiers,"Powerful deities and warlords strive for dominance over the Plane of Fire and the rest of the Inner Sphere in order to prove fire's supremacy. Armies of flaming soldiers go to war against each other on battlefields of smoke and smoldering char, all unable to bring their full power to bear. Ymeri, the vicious and victorious Queen of the Inferno, commands legions of sootsoldiers: elementals capable of battling the armies of her foes and, even when destroyed, rising from the ashes of the Eternal Furnace, scorched and triumphant.",,10
Sorcerous Skull Swarm,"The act of creating a demilich sometimes goes horribly awry, leaving behind a shattered remnant of a once-mighty spellcaster constantly leaking eldritch energies. The ruined spirit animates a cloud of debased copies of itself, glittering with cracked crystals in crude imitation, and it hungers constantly for the magical energies denied it in its corrupted immortality. Some of the spellcaster's personality remains in the swarm, albeit usually unnaturally split between the skulls. As a consequence, the skulls argue among themselves as warring parts of the personality clamor to be heard, resulting in the swarm's fractious, inconstant attitude.",Skull Swarm,14
Sordesdaemon,"Hulks of sewage and daemonic flesh, sordesdaemons embody death through pollution and are among the newest types of daemons to appear on Golarion. Sordesdaemons are fiendishly clever and often seek to inspire mortals with new ideas and inventions that despoil the environment.",Daemon,15
Soul Eater,Only the most desperate or foolhardy conjurers call upon the aid of these strange fiends from the inky swamps of Abaddon.,,7
Soul Skelm,"Soul skelms arise not from mortal men but from other skelms, as their long-held wrath slowly twists them and replaces lingering fragments of their mortality with even more fiendish aspects. These skelms bully and exploit the souls of the dead, binding souls and undead to keep themselves indefinitely young. They bully living victims as well, stoking regret and shame even from inconsequential minutiae or outright fabrications until these feelings become unbreakable ties that the skelm can leverage from beyond the grave. A soul skelm's attentions can leave a victim isolated from friends and allies, making them all the more susceptible to the skelm's manipulations. Ambitious soul skelms—often those who arise from palace skelms—search out powerful, high-strung mortals and trick them into bringing ridicule or shame on themselves. After their victim's death, the skelms gleefully remind them of their mortal failings, feeding on their despair.",Skelm,10
Soul Slime,"Soul slimes are swirling, blue-gray masses of protoplasm that feed on the quintessence contained within souls. Typically, soul slimes acquire this quintessence by consuming the living, the undead, or souls imprisoned in other objects, although soul slimes can also feed on the quintessence of the Outer Planes and their occupants. Soul slimes digest these siphoned souls over decades. As long as a portion of a soul remains undigested, a soul slime can adopt the shape and use the vocalizations of that soul—a tactic soul slimes routinely adopt to get close to their prey while hunting. As soul slimes lack the intelligence to truly impersonate or mimic the souls they digest, they are obvious facsimiles and are entirely incapable of speech.",,18
Soulbound Doll,"Soulbound dolls are eerie mannequins or playthings that have been imbued with a small piece of a deceased mortal’s soul. These little constructs are created for a variety of reasons—such as to serve as companions or servants—but their free will means their obedience to their creators is hardly a given. Followers of Pharasma generally abhor soulbound dolls, viewing them as a perversion of the natural cycle of souls, and those who worship the Lady of Graves see the destruction of a soulbound doll, regardless of the construct’s alignment, as an important service to the Great Beyond. Soulbound dolls are the simplest in a series of soulbound constructs including human-sized soulbound mannequins, powerful soulbound shells, and sentinel soulbound terra-cotta warriors. Creating them from unwilling living creatures is evil, and an unwilling donor can resist the process with a successful Will save against the creator’s Craft DC, ruining the doll if not preventing the donor’s death. A non-evil doll can only be crafted from the soul of a person who has given consent to such use before their death occurred Soulbound dolls encountered by adventurers are typically guardians of some sort; despite their diminutive size, the soul fragment’s power makes the doll’s flst more dangerous than a casual observer would expect. Further, it grants the doll a single spell of outsized power given its stature. Because of their autonomy and remarkable intelligence, soulbound dolls are occasionally employed by their crafters as administrators over much more powerful but mindless constructs such as golems, allowing such dolls to control defenses far beyond their own capabilities. Though soulbound dolls contain a small fragment of a soul extracted during or shortly after a person’s death, this doesn’t affect the deceased’s resurrection or progress to the afterlife. This extraction process is lethal to otherwise-living prospective soul donors, though there are rumors of more expensive processes that allows someone to donate a fragment of a living soul without repercussions. The soul fragment resides in a soul focus gem (Hardness 10) typically embedded in the doll’s neck or chest. The soul fragment isn’t static, and the doll continues to learn from its initial state, meaning its personality and abilities can change, possibly growing closer to the donor’s or moving farther a  eld on its own individual path. The soulbound doll’s focus gem retains the doll’s memories even after the doll’s destruction. The the intact soul focus gem of a destroyed doll can even be placed into a new doll body by someone knowledgeable in the creation of soulbound creatures, effectively reconstituting the soulbound doll.",,2
Soulbound Mauler,"If a soulbound doll isn't large and strong enough for one's needs, there's the oversized soulbound mauler. An upgrade to the soulbound doll, this mannequin is powered by the entire soul of a sapient creature. Many a necromancer has attempted to use these constructs as a method to live forever, likely as a shortcut around the complicated and ultimately morbid path to lichdom. However, the soul within the mannequin has problems properly expressing itself and displays rudimentary control over the host, often resulting in childlike behavior anywhere from curious to sadistic. Rather than embedding the soul focus gem in the construct's neck or chest, it's tethered by bands of ectoplasm within an exposed chamber on the mannequin's chest. Until the soulbound mauler is destroyed, the focus gem cannot be removed from the empty cavity in its chest. However, the gem can be displaced which causes the soulbound mauler significant anguish, not only damaging the connection between the gem and artificial body, but also impairing the construct's ability to function.",,4
Soulbound Ruin,"Those who tread in ruined places sometimes speak of a sense that a supernatural presence is there alongside them, as if the spirits of the dead were watching intently. Such presences can be very real, often taking the form of ghosts or other shades of undead that cannot let go of their attachment to the Material Plane. But sometimes, instead of manifesting as distinct spirits, the souls of the dead infuse the very stone and mortar around them. When enough souls attach themselves to a single place—be it a home, crypt, or castle—it can take on a life of its own, becoming a soulbound ruin.",,15
Spark Bat,Spark bats congregate around volatile weather in the Plane of Air.,"Elemental, Air",2
Spear Frog,"The spear frog is named for its toxin, which is traditionally used to envenom thrown projectiles like spears and daggers.",Frog,0
Specter,"When an evil mortal creature dies, it sometimes returns to haunt the area of its death as a specter, a hateful remnant, always seeking to slay others—particularly humanoids—in an attempt to distribute its pain among as many souls as it can. A specter maintains a strange semblance of its prior identity, but with a corrupted sense of purpose. It cannot be reasoned with. A specter denied the opportunity to harm living humanoids grows increasingly agonized and irrational, akin to the mindset of a starving person forever denied a release from agony through death.",,7
Spellskein,"Magic can be used for many purposes—creating objects, summoning creatures, and manipulating the elements. Usually when a ritual is cast, the outcome is reliable and predictable, but sometimes magic takes unexpected turns and a spell's energy lands in unintended places. Spellskeins are scraps of fabric and paper infused with magic and brought to life. Once animated, they fold themselves into different shapes, changing both their appearance and their abilities based on their configuration. Spellskeins are only rarely aggressive and sometimes downright timid, but most have a playful streak. Though they are often made accidentally out of magical leakage from rituals, some ritualists intentionally create spellskeins to serve as magical toys or animated decor. These planned spellskeins tend to be more obedient and less mischievous than their accidental counterparts, following commands or routines set by their creators even after said creators are long gone. Scrap pieces torn from the body of a spellskein sometimes animate as ever smaller, more mischievous constructs, which usually dart away to hide until it's safe to come out and cause trouble.",,0
Sphinx,"Sphinxes are mystical beings with the body of a lion, the wings of a great bird, and the upper torso and head of a human. They are often maligned in legends as nothing more than monsters, and though they are quick to anger and are capable of exacting deadly retribution for perceived slights, they are also very intelligent. Sphinxes are often associated with desert regions, but they can dwell in more moderate climates as well. They form small groups consisting of a single, extended family that hunts and works together to protect and teach their young. As they mature, sphinxes develop a wanderlust, a drive to gather hidden lore and solve the world’s greatest riddles—the trait that is perhaps most often identified with their kind. While sometimes bound into service as guardians for powerful spellcasters, lone sphinxes may also be encountered on journeys of discovery and as purveyors of esoteric lore. If treated with the proper respect—and fed well—a sphinx can demonstrate a willingness to exchange information. Their favorite currency is, of course, riddles and secrets. One who can trade knowledge for knowledge has a much better chance of succeeding while bargaining with a sphinx. However, a sphinx’s insatiable thirst for new riddles as well their extensive collection of secrets accumulated over hundreds of years of life—makes it difficult to offer them something they don’t already know. Those who attempt to trade petty insight and stale riddles may invoke a sphinx’s ire and will not live long enough to regret it.",Sphinx,8
Spider Swarm,"An abundance of food, the sudden hatching of a clutch of eggs, or magical influence can cause smaller spiders to gather in terrifying, deadly masses.",Spider,0
Spinosaurus,"The spinosaurus is more than just one of the largest carnivorous dinosaurs—it's also one of the most unusual in appearance, with a large, sail-like fin running along its spine. Often quite colorful, this sail allows the spinosaurus to attract mates, aids in swimming, and makes it appear to be even larger than it actually is. A swimming spinosaurus can also use the sail as part of a unique means of staggering prey by slapping the water with it to make a crushing wave.The spinosaurus is equally at home in water as it is on land, and its long, toothy maw is well-adapted to catching swimming prey. Attempts by giants to capture spinosauruses to serve as guardians typically go poorly, for these headstrong dinosaurs do not domesticate well. Their surly attitudes and striking appearances make them better suited for bloodsports, and they are popular prizes for those who run arenas specializing in battles that pit gladiators against hungry animals or beasts. Of course, an angry dinosaur forced to fight for the amusement of others won't discriminate between potential meals on the battleground and ones seated in the surrounding stands.The spinosaurus's appearance and strength make it attractive to more than just giants and bloodsport organizers. Spellcasters who mutate and transform animals into magical guardians have long been intrigued by the spinosaurus's potential. More so than any other dinosaurs, spinosauruses have been subjected to fleshwarping procedures, crossbreeding with monsters, and other magical techniques to enhance the creatures' viability as effective guardians.A spinosaurus can measure up to 60 feet in length and weighs 25,000 pounds.",Dinosaur,11
Spiny Eurypterid,"Spiny eurypterids are aggressive, tenacious, and utterly unwilling to stop chasing prey, even to their own detriment. These creatures are covered with countless needle-like spikes and can grow to rival the size of ocean mammals like orcas. Sailors often find them clinging to the hulls of ships, as spiny eurypterids mistake them for prey and are too stubborn to let go.",Eurypterid,5
Spiral Centurion,"These mechanical constructs were created to serve as guardians in an ancient and bygone era, although exactly who made them and the secrets of their construction have long since been lost to history. From the waist up, they resemble humanoids made of metal, but from the waist down their bodies take the form of spinning metal tops ringed with blades, which excel at cutting down nearby foes. Most spiral centurions can be directed to stand down with a password, although often these command phrases have been lost to the mists of time. In rare cases, a spiral centurion may also wield manufactured weapons or a shield in addition to its built-in weapons, giving it access to additional actions besides those listed below. Most spiral centurions are hundreds or even thousands of years old, only staying functional because of the powerful magic used in their creation. Still, millennia of neglect have caused many spiral centurions to develop small glitches or malfunctions.",,11
Spirit Naga,"In naga culture, the foul-tempered, unkempt spirit naga holds a contemptible place similar to that of hags in humanoid cultures. These decrepit creatures live out lives of solitude, sought out only by those who are foolish or brave enough to think they can benefit from the spirit naga's powers without paying a heavy price—for most who dare to show such hubris, the price is their own lives. Spirit nagas seek out desolate ruins and places long associated with death and corruption. These sinister, serpentine beings can be found in abandoned graveyards, crumbled fortresses, rotting swamps, and blighted woodlands. Though they may know little of the actual history of such places, the nagas are nonetheless attracted to the psychic remnants of evil deeds and tormented spirits that remain within the earth and stones there. Despite their hideous appearance and treatment as pariahs by other nagas, spirit nagas feel a profound pride in their abilities and even in their hermetic existences. They see themselves as connected to a greater force whose mysteries are revealed only to those who can cast off the trappings and morals of “civilized” society. Even so, spirit nagas gleefully accept the worship of other creatures willing to bow to their capricious whims. They often form cults around themselves, using their charm spells and rituals to ensnare the minds of a few key individuals who spread the nagas' foul influence throughout a community.",Naga,9
Spirit Turtle,"Spirit turtles are benevolent fey known to heal those in need and confer other powerful gifts. These gentle giants resemble enormous turtles and often bear entire ecosystems on their shells. In ancient times, so the legend goes, spirit turtles used to grant wishes to many mortals. After millennia of such encounters, the giant creatures grew tired and went into hiding or returned to their home plane, the First World. Those few spirit turtles who remain on Golarion now grant their favors only to the purest and worthiest mortal petitioners.",,21
Spiritbound Aluum,"Whereas most aluums are animated by the souls of volunteers loyal to Katapesh, the Pactmasters created a handful of more capable (and deadly) aluums powered by the souls of a dozen or more dangerous criminals. These spiritbound aluums are rarely used as peacekeepers, instead serving as assassins, elite bodyguards, or riot control during times of martial law. A spiritbound aluum has a dull blue crystalline focus that stores constituent souls, surrounded by a host of smaller gems used for trapping souls the Pactmasters wish to deny from entering the Great Beyond. Spiritbound aluums rarely use this soul-binding ability except when instructed by their masters. However, the murderous or embittered souls within the aluum sometimes exert control and willfully consume a departing soul either out of malice or to incorporate it into the construct’s core. If not relieved of its trapped souls in a timely manner, a spiritbound aluum can develop enough will to overcome its masters’ orders and even awaken to full sentience. These rogue aluums typically lose the mindless trait, are evil, have an Intelligence modifier of –2 or higher, and gain several skills with bonuses ranging from +25 to +32.",Aluum,16
Sporeborn Myceloid,"While most sporeborn are created from the flesh of vertebrates or creatures with exoskeletons, fungal and plant creatures serve as a fine host for a sporeborn's parasitic spores. In these cases, the sporeborn mycelial network burrows through the corpse, replacing the original hyphae in fungal creatures and the xylem and pith in plants. This allows the sporeborn to puppet the creature, much as it does in mammals by replacing the tendons with its own rugged mycelium. Fungus and plant hosts are more likely to develop the potent poison sporeborn ability to enhance the hosts' natural abilities.",Sporeborn,4
Sportlebore Swarm,A swarm of sportlebores is a much more dangerous foe than a single insect.,Sportlebore,7
Spriggan Bully,"The typical spriggan is a bully who prefers to take live prisoners in fights, but only to ensure that they have a large stock of living victims to torment, tease, and abuse. They train to use weapons in nonlethal ways that inflict the maximum amount of pain even as they guard against accidental death. When not bullying prisoners or hunting for new victims, spriggan bullies enjoy drinking, watching others fight, and fighting among themselves.",Spriggan,3
Spriggan Warlord,"While the leaders of larger spriggan enclaves tend to be uniquely trained warriors with highly specialized skills, spriggan warlords are fond of the traditional spriggan weaponry of morningstar and crossbow, valuing this traditional fighting style for its simplicity and for using both weapons to their full potential. Spriggan warlords often serve as sub-commanders in large groups, filling roles in spriggan society akin to captains of the guard or bodyguards to spriggan royalty. In smaller groups or remote outposts, a single spriggan warlord is typically in charge of a band of spriggan bullies.",Spriggan,7
Sprite,"Common sprites are primeval guardians that latch onto a person, place, or object and defend it for their own inscrutable reasons. Their dispositions vary from kind to spiteful, but all sprites have a capricious streak. Being only about 9 inches tall, they are wary of animals that might hunt them, particularly house cats, and prefer flight to a fight. On the other hand, sprites are incredibly curious about all forms of magic and heedlessly gather around ley line nexuses or other places of power.",Sprite,-1
Spy,"No empire would be complete without its spies. The spy is a master of infiltrating the court and blending in: they might be one of a number of nobles, a beloved confidante of the queen, or even the court jester. Spies use their skills to subtly manipulate courtiers, turn enemies against one another, and collect valuable information either for blackmail or to auction to the highest bidder.",Courtiers,6
Squirming Swill,"Grotesque pieces of cast-off animal carcasses slowly stew into an overcooked mass at the bottom of a witch or hag's cauldron. The animals' magical organs— the eyes of the newt, the tongue of the frog—have already been removed, leaving only these sad remains. Nevertheless, animated by long exposure to magic, they sometimes peel free from the sides of the cauldron and wriggle out to freedom. The refuse moves in one giant mass, its skin blackened and crispy, leaving a trail of dripping grease and gravy. Its body is perpetually steaming hot, as though fresh from the pot, fat popping and sizzling. Squirming swills wander kitchens, sewers, swamps, midden pits, and grimy city canals. With little intelligence and no agenda, they come after any creature that remotely resembles the one who stewed them—usually, anything humanoid will do. Most swills try immediately to kill the creature, but some approach longingly, as though reuniting with a lost parent. They also seem to show sympathy or fellowship to other small animals. Unfortunately, their grotesque scent or the heat of their touch tends to scare away the living. Handily, the squirming swill is just as happy to befriend a small animal's corpse, unconcerned about its level of decay.",,2
Squirrel Swarm,"Descending with a shriek, a swarm of squirrels is a menace to foes, crawling in and out of pockets and clothing, biting and scratching as it goes. Though squirrels are usually independent, they might form into swarms when cornered or if a predator creates enough of a recurring threat that the little creatures need to gang up.",Squirrel,1
Ssumzili,"Ssumzilis are lanky, murderous fey who delight in the thrill of the hunt. They are particularly skilled/adept at stalking their prey in the rain and most commonly reside in rainforests and coastal regions, where frequent rain provides ample opportunity to hunt. Camouflaged by their cloud-gray skin, ssumzilis often compete in tests of stealth when hunting in groups, taking particular delight in approaching their quarry as closely as possible without being observed.",,12
Star Archon,"Embodiments of the virtue of prudence, star archons serve as philosophers and administrators, and in times of war as the tacticians, strategists, and generals of archon armies. Star archons burn with the glory and intensity of a sun, and their sense of duty and desire to defeat evil are as indefatigable as the light of the stars. While their dazzling intellects and unmatched strategic cunning make them most useful in war rooms rather than on battlefields, star archons are fierce opponents when motivated to enter the fray. Those who witness the self-sacrifice of a star archon and live to tell the tale describe the experience in terms that might befit the sight of a supernova at the instant the star collapses in on itself.",Archon,19
Steam Mephit,"These brash and arrogant creatures are among the more energetic mephits. They are quick to nominate themselves the leaders of any group, barking out orders in shrill, high-pitched voices and insisting on having everything done their way. Even when they aren't bossing others around, the constant hiss of steam escaping from their pores ensures that there is never a quiet moment.","Elemental, Mephit",1
Stegosaurus,"The stegosaurus is easily recognized by its twin rows of diamond-shaped dorsal plates that run down its spine, and thick tail adorned with four large spikes. This strange configuration protects this herbivore from predators, as the stegosaurus can hunker down to interpose its dorsal plates between an attacker and its thick body. A stegosaurus defends itself by swinging its spiked tail at larger foes and trampling smaller opponents underfoot. The stegosaurus often inhabits grasslands, where nutritious vegetation is plentiful and only its dorsal plates rise above waving fields of tall grass. The stegosaurus is among the most curious of dinosaurs, and hunters often find it easy to bait them with shiny trinkets or strange noises. A stegosaurus is about 30 feet long, 16 feet high at the top of its highest dorsal plate, and weighs between 2 and 3 tons. The stegosaurus is generally more even-tempered and even gentle, despite its size, than the ankylosaurus. This combination makes it even more popular as a trained pet or guard, but even then one should take care to not annoy the dinosaur—an angry or annoyed stegosaurus can lash out with its tail with little warning. Often, it’s wiser to train smaller variants, such as the kentrosaurus. Regardless, their dorsal plates make this dinosaur a poor choice as a mount.",Dinosaur,7
Stheno Harpist,"With living snakes for hair, sthenos, who are descended from medusas, are a curious and independent ancestry. A newly emergent people, sthenos have existed for just barely over a century. Only a few generations have passed since their genesis, and some adult sthenos remember members of the original generation. Indeed, since sthenos can live about as long as humans, a few of the original sthenos might yet live somewhere. As a people without a traditional homeland, sthenos seek to find societies that welcome them, which can be a challenging endeavor. With more than a passing resemblance to medusas, given their ophidian hair and striking features, they find most places are wary if not outright hostile to their presence.",Stheno,1
Sthira,"The Wall of Heaven claims many intrepid climbers. Some such travelers come seeking fortune. Others seek enlightenment. Many, however, find only an icy death. With no means for a proper burial, many of these unfortunate souls remain abandoned to the ice, their bodies becoming macabre guideposts along mountain trails. Through means unknown, the most willful of these frozen travelers reanimate to seek vengeance upon the living for their denied burial. Such creatures, called sthiras, are composed of multiple bodies or body parts frozen together into one horrific monstrosity.",,20
Stingray,"Found in salt or fresh water, stingrays are normally passive creatures, but when threatened or cornered, they lash out with their tails to lance foes with their toxic stingers. Stingrays often bury themselves in mud, sand, or sea grass, and unfortunately for those wading in shallow waters, stepping on an unseen stingray is a surefire way to receive a painful sting.",Ray,0
Stone Giant,"Stone giants are stoic, reclusive herders and artists who have a rich history and collection of traditions. They dwell in caves in tall mountains and craggy ranges, where their grayish skin allows them to blend in with their surroundings and go unnoticed by imperceptive adventurers. Those benign travelers who come across a tribe of stone giants need not worry much, however, for stone giants do not actively invite confrontation or strife. They are, by and large, a peaceful people who seek wisdom through exploration of nature and long meditations on the elements of the natural world. Their elders are the wisest of stone giants, and use their charisma and druidic magic to lead their tribes to prosperity and harmony with nature. A typical stone giant stands 12 feet in height and weighs about 1,500 pounds.",Giant,8
Stone Golem,"Stone golems are slow and steady constructs typically carved from marble or granite. They’re often made to serve as works of art when at rest, so some golem crafters employ master sculptors to ensure the constructs make beautiful statues. Older stone golems might be weathered, with scuffed or cracked surfaces or missing noses and digits, but this weathering is largely cosmetic and doesn’t adversely impact the golems’ functionality. Tales tell of particularly immense stone golems residing in certain ancient ruins. Survivors from time-lost civilizations bent on carrying out orders from long-gone masters, these immense stone golems are much more powerful than most stone golems. They are always level 15 or higher and never smaller than Huge in size—most are Gargantuan. Because their size is so great and the structures they dwell in so dilapidated, the awakening of such a stone golem can cause surrounding structures to collapse, ancient foundations to buckle, and ceilings to come crashing down on foes. In addition to the statistics here, these massive stone golems attack with wide, sweeping strikes capable of knocking down multiple targets at once.",Golem,11
Stone Lion,"Stone lions are a common sight outside of banks, temples, palaces, and even private residences. The fierce expressions affixed on their faces remind passersby to stay on their best behavior. Stone lions remain faithful guardians of a site, regardless of whether it falls into disrepair. Even if people abandon a place, the lion remains dutiful until its statue is too worn or broken to inhabit any longer.",Guardian Beast,4
Stone Lion Cub,"Stone lion cubs are curious, playful, and occasionally accidental mischief makers. Despite their still developing abilities, they eagerly hone their skills with make-believe missions. Many hope that they'll one day become responsible guardians like their parents. Smaller in stature and ferocity, stone lion cubs sometimes try to guard places of smaller importance, often including facsimiles of the same kinds of structures their parents attend. They're less than dependable as guardians, as they have the attention span and rambunctious nature of children. Their parents often need to call them to heel, ordering them to stay at the parent's side as parent and child both stay motionless for the rising day.",Guardian Beast,2
Stone Mauler,These towering heaps of earth can inflict tremendous damage up close and from afar.,"Elemental, Earth",9
Stone-Breasted Owl,"Sage spirit guides are among the wisest spirits. They often take the forms of raptors such as owls, using their keen senses to evaluate situations from high above before swooping in to aid imperiled mortals. Adventurers who befriend a sage guide are fortunate indeed; in addition to providing sage counsel before conflict begins, sage guides can restore and tend to their allies in the aftermath of a violent dispute. In many stories, the sage guide assumes the form of a large owl whose proud breast is composed of hard stone. This depiction combines the wisdom commonly attributed to the owl with the strength and fortitude of the earth.",Spirit Guide,5
Storied Harrowkin,These harrowkin take on themes drawn from a specific harrow card.,Harrowkin,10
Storm Giant,"Storm giants are looming but benevolent stewards of sea and sky, often serving as the natural guardians of tropical islands, coastlines, or rocky archipelagos. Storm giants tend to rapidly shift in mood and behavior, one moment engaging in peaceful negotiation, the next unleashing unbridled ferocity against their foes. In this way, they embody both the fury of a raging tempest and the calm of a hurricane’s eye. This can make them valuable allies who race to the aid of those in need, but their allies remain must be alert and mindful of their mood, as the giants can be quick to anger or aggressive when caution is most appropriate. Most storm giants have complexions akin to the crystal blue of the ocean or the warm violet of a sky touched by the setting sun. Their hair tends to be dark purple, blue, or black, and their eyes often have a silvery sheen. A typical storm giant stands 21 feet tall, weighs 12,000 pounds, and lives to be about 600 years old.",Giant,13
Storm Hag,"Storm hags are the personification of a storm's rage. These crones hate those who huddle together with loved ones in warm, dry shelters while the wind howls and rain lashes the land and sea. Storm hags use their powers to wreak havoc on communities near the coastal caves or hovels where they often live. These hags send their voices on the wind to terrorize mortals before descending upon them with claws and fell magic. More than any others of their kind, they prey on the young, devouring children as much for the pain it causes their parents and caretakers as for the hags' love of young flesh. A storm hag's territory sometimes overlaps with that of sea hags and winter hags. While this may result in the formation of a coven that controls their combined territories, more often it leads to rivalries. Such feuds only increase the misery of innocent people caught between the rival hags' feuding.",Hag,5
Storm Lord,Storm lords wage battles to claim important territory within the Plane of Air.,"Elemental, Air",9
Straugh,"When skirmishes break out between tunneling ghouls and creatures that dwell beneath the surface of Golarion, there's a chance that ghoul fever could infect such animals, producing strange new variants of ghoul beasts. However, letting the natural corruption run its course sometimes results in unsatisfying monsters, so some necromancers speed the process. This is the situation that led to the creation of the first straugh. A priest of Kabriri made the monstrosity to defend a claimed cemetery from another sect of ghouls who were preying upon the interred bodies. In some places, ghouls use straughs to tunnel into rival warrens or highly fortified mausoleums.",,10
Street Skelm,"Street skelms abuse the deference given to elders and the well-to-do in public spaces, appearing as such so they can verbally or physically punish those who dare defy their cruel sensibilities. To excuse his actions or gather allies, a street skelm might rant about a target, building a pretense of some vague threat the target poses to the community's social order. These rantings can rally a mob to carry out the skelm's violence against his target, some of whom even act out of fear against becoming the skelm's next target. Street skelms have little of the magical talents possessed by their more powerful peers, mostly relying on brute force. Street skelms typically dress in old-fashioned styles, always including a hat or hood that can cover their distinctive features. They often walk with a cane, walking staff, or other prop suitable for bludgeoning those who offend their delicate egos or challenge their tenuous sense of control.",Skelm,3
Striding Fire,"An embodiment of the speed and chaos of a spreading blaze, a striding fire appears as a lithe and long-limbed humanoid composed of shifting-hued flames churning within a skeleton-like framework.","Elemental, Fire",6
Strix Kinmate,"Strix are avian humanoids with sprawling, dark-feathered wings and large talons. Strix possess angular features and piercing eyes that are fixed facing forward. Their lurching head movements and vertical eyelids give an unnerving quality to their humanoid appearances.",Strix,2
Sturzstromer,Cobble mites that remain a cohesive swarm for many years become dangerous living landslides.,Cobble Mite,19
Stygira,"Withered hermits wrapped in tattered rags, these scarred, eyeless creatures command strange secrets of the earth and interpret the fateful energies of the subterranean depths. In some regions, stygiras are worshipped as seers or even gods, although they lack the ability to grant spells to clerics and are often not aware of their worshippers at all. In other areas, they have strange ties to the ancient empires of the cyclopes, often dwelling in the oversized ruins those creatures left behind long ago. To many stygiras, gemstones harvested from ancient cyclopean mosaics have even greater magical properties than other crystals. Although technically blind, stygiras do have vestigial eyes hidden beneath the stony, scarred flesh of their faces. Capable of sensing bright lights even through their scars, stygiras are sickened and distracted by these flashing glimpses, so they keep to their caves during the day and wander into the world above only after nightfall. Far from benevolent, they seek out unwary travelers or explorers to capture and reduce them down to the base chemicals and supernatural humors the stygiras require to infuse gemstones with the capacity to give them sight and magical power.",,7
Succubus,"Succubi are manifestations of the sin of destructive lust, and they are the most attractive of all demons—as befits their role in seducing mortals to fall to sin. The concept of gender is fluid to a succubus, as they can adopt countless humanoid forms of any gender to aid in their goals. Most succubi have a feminine true form (incubi, which usually have a masculine true form, are a different kind of demon), but regardless of gender, a lust demon is supernaturally beautiful or handsome, but with curving horns, bat wings, sharp claws, and a sinuous tail. When disguised as a mortal humanoid on the Material Plane, a succubus whispers into the ears of mortals, urging them to pursue their darkest and most destructive desires and pushing them into depravity, using magic only if persuasion fails. While mortals often fixate on succubi’s application of sexual lust, these demons are can easily exploit lust for power, knowledge, fame, or any other desire as easily as more carnal appetites. Their ability to infiltrate societies makes them excellent spies, assassins, and political saboteurs as well. Ultimately, the succubus enjoys all means of upending mortal culture.",Demon,7
Sulfur Zombie,"Glowing with a dull amber light, these odious creatures spawn from a combination of necromancy and fire. These destructive creations sow chaos and demolish fortifications, making them the bane of besieged cities.",Zombie,6
Suli Dune Dancer,"Because their genie forebears are native to the Material Plane, sulis (scions of mortals and jann) are by and large the most common geniekin on the Material Plane. They are often artisans and peace brokers, compelled to try and bring harmony and balance in a world wrought with discord. Sulis have a natural charm that often eludes other geniekin, but tend to layer on a level of boastful pride or even arrogance as a personal quirk or humorous facade. Few non-sulis realize that bragging is not simply the symptom of a puffed-up ego for sulis, but instead is a cultural institution easily comparable to human poetry. Sulis' boasts not only glorify themselves, but also secure their companions' and families' accomplishments in history, with the ultimate goal of spinning stories that will be retold for generations. This is especially true for sulis who have lived with other geniekin and have been seen as lesser for not having a strong connection to an Elemental Plane. Suli dune dancers are but one way these geniekin seek to integrate with other humanoid societies. They work to hone their skills at boasting to an extent that their claims help to bolster those they travel with. Suli from regions other than deserts adjust their names to match their terrains, but regardless of whether they prefer forests, hills, or arctic plains, their boasts remain as compelling.",Geniekin,1
Sumbreiva,"Sumbreivas are the Negative Energy Plane's unstoppable hunters, tracking down and destroying other creatures on their plane for sport and practice. Occasionally they pass through a rift or are brought to the Material Plane via planar binding, where they collect living souls to display as trophies. Sumbreivas gather at Night Lodges, where they train and display their soul trophies, which appear as floating wisps of blue energy. The more formidable the soul, the more intense the blue glow that emanates from it. Sumbreivas in lodges periodically raid the Material Plane on a Night Hunt. Over the course of one night, the sumbreivas from that lodge split up and compete to see who can capture the most brilliant souls as trophies. The winner of the Night Hunt leads the lodge until the next hunt. Night Lodges are ranked against each other by the accomplishments of the hunters within. All sumbreivas have the ultimate goal of capturing a soul worthy of being placed in the Twilight Lodge, reserved for the truly elite souls and hunters.",,16
Summer Hora,"While most nymphs bond with a natural feature, such as a tree, pool, or cave, horai are rare nymphs associated with a specific time—the summer or winter solstice—rather than a location. Horai erect simple astronomical calendars near their home, which they use to mark the moment when the sun reaches its highest or lowest point in the sky. An hora tied to the summer solstice grows more powerful as the sun reaches its height, while an hora tied to the winter solstice is sickly and weak. The opposite holds true for winter horai, who are weak in summer and strong in winter. Meanwhile, autumn and spring horai draw power near the autumnal and vernal equinoxes, becoming weaker around the opposite equinox. Summer horai appear constantly bathed in sunlight, with skin and clothing of red, orange, and yellow, like the sunlight of high summer.",Nymph,6
Summer Hora Queen,"Hora queens rule over wide stretches of land, nourishing and protecting native animals and plants. Most hora queens watch over their regions in pairs: one summer and one winter, or one autumn and one spring.",Nymph,13
Sunburst Corpse,"Warlords and heroes alike often fell their enemies and leave the corpses behind, exposed to the elements. Undead tend to rise in the dark of night and shun the cleansing rays of the sun, but this isn't the rule for all undead. The corpse of a particularly evil individual left exposed to the constant beating of the sun might become a sunburst corpse. These undead radiate light and wield sunlight as a weapon. Sunburst corpses initially seek revenge for their deaths but thereafter wander with undirected rage.",,14
Sunflower Leshy,"Sunflower leshys are the ambassadors and social leaders of their kind. Their petals radiate from their heads in various hues with a serrated, leafy, beard-like ruff. When particularly excited, their eyes and petals glow with collected sunlight, and when they become depressed or saddened, their usually vibrant coloration grows correspondingly muted. These shifts in coloration are echoed in sunflower leshy art, which can lead to unexpected color palettes for artworks. For example, a human artist might illustrate Hell as a place of glowing lava and flickering flames, drawing upon many vibrant colors, but to a sunflower leshy, the only proper way to depict a place like Hell is in morose grays, blacks, and whites. The more adventurous sunflower leshys leave their communities to grow bonds with nearby settlements of humanoids. When interacting with humanoids, sunflower leshys are some of the most likely to act friendly and give strangers a chance to prove their good intentions, though they remain cautious. They're often accompanied by other, more powerful leshys.",Leshy,1
Surgeon,"The surgeon specializes in the physical alteration of the body to prevent the spread of disease, removing necrotic and decaying flesh to help the whole to survive. Few healers know the science of anatomy and physiology better than the surgeon. While their expertise is of grave importance in the medical world, the downside is that when one is in need of their talents, it is likely the complaint is serious. In medical matters, a surgeon is a 6th-level challenge.",Healers,2
Suvarden,"While the Material Plane and the Dimension of Time remain distinct realities, the two share a powerful connection. Suvardens are living embodiments of this connection.",,7
Svartalfar Killer,"Long ago in the mists of history, the fey ancestors of the svartalfars were banished from the First World for crimes too heinous to name. These beings made a new home on the Shadow Plane, which warped their minds and essence and turned them into cold, ruthless killers. Their clans are places of safety but not kindness for svartalfars; they feel no amity toward others, and their actions almost exclusively focus on practicalities. Svartalfars resemble expressionless elves with pale eyes and gray skin. Many have smooth, bald heads, while others keep their hair short and practical. Svartalfars seem untouched by emotions, especially compassion or mercy. When given a contract, a svartalfar clan seeks its target with grim diligence. Money means next to nothing to them, and attempts to appeal for pity go unheard. A svartalfar clan knows that if they don't end the target's life, another clan will do so, which is a blow to the reputation and standing of the clan that failed. Svartalfar communities on the Shadow Plane are usually very small, featuring slender towers and extensive underground chambers. Built on or near thin spots between the Shadow Plane and the Material Plane, these communities allow svartalfars easy access to Golarion, where many of their targets reside. ",,8
Swordkeeper,"Collectors who want to guard their magical arsenals procure or build swordkeepers. These constructs are equal parts display case and security system, each holding a single weapon within its body and projecting copies of the weapon it stores to deter would-be thieves.",,10
Sykever,"The most common darvakkas are sykevers, walkers in the night. Bloodthirsty but calculating, they lead legions of dead into battle on the Material Plane, working toward the simple goal of ending all life.",Darvakka,15
Sylph Sneak,"Born with elemental gales coursing through their breath, sylphs are wispy planar scions whose bodies seem caught in a perpetual, gentle breeze. Born of unions between mortals and djinn, sylphs are quick-witted and creative, but they are prone to flights of fancy and tend to be easily distracted. Sylphs are notorious for their practice of “listening to the wind,” which most others dismiss as a fancy name for eavesdropping. Yet this custom means much more to sylphs, who spend hours listening to the stories brought to them on the proverbial breeze. While some less scrupulous sylphs may use the information they learn to blackmail or abuse others, most of them see listening to the wind as their way of staying connected to the world around them while still keeping it comfortably at arm's length. Certainly the typical sylph sneak doesn't seek to use what they learn for ill, but instead tries to warn others of dangers yet unrealized or to prepare themself for a dangerous task.",Geniekin,1
Ta'apundo,"The First World still holds the first rough draft of many creatures in the Material Plane, but it's hard to tell what sort of creature the ta'apundo was ever intended to be. Its bark poses significant danger to metallic objects, as it converts any metal touching it into wood as fibrous and as flexible as its own body. Capricious and skittish, ta'apundos make friends easily but consider anyone who wields or wears metal to be a hated enemy.",,19
Taiga Giant,"Taiga giants prefer a nomadic lifestyle, both to keep from depleting any one area's resources while satiating their massive appetites and to satisfy a constant wanderlust. They are deeply spiritual and frequently commune with their ancestors' spirits for guidance and knowledge. Taiga giants are happiest when they are left alone to live out their traditional lives, and their impressive size and strength are enough to persuade all but the most dangerous foes to do so. Taiga giants subsist on migratory herds of aurochs, mammoths, and elk. They occasionally raid humanoid villages, but such cases are opportunistic rather than malicious, with a focus on stealing away livestock for food rather than people. Nevertheless, the arrival of a group of taiga giants is a potentially devastating event to any town or village, so many communities attempt to placate the giants by creating a yearly offering at those times when they know the giants are scheduled to come close. Most taiga giants venerate their ancestors and seek to honor their works in everything they do. This deep connection makes them ferociously proud of those legacies, and little can compel taiga giants to go to war more swiftly than insulting their ancestors. Merely mentioning the false rumors that ancient taiga giant spellcasters were responsible for the creation of the first rune giants is a surefire way to earn a taiga giant's unending wrath. A taiga giant stands 20 feet tall and weighs 10,000 pounds.",Giant,12
Taiga Linnorm,"Taiga linnorms are covered in hundreds of quill-like black spines as sharp as spears. Wise hunters native to linnorm-infested lands know to watch for spines stuck in the bark of conifers—a sure sign that a taiga linnorm has recently passed through. Sometimes this means of tracking isn't enough to avoid an encounter, however; taiga linnorms, like their tarn and tor brethren, are skilled stalkers. They prefer to lurk in half-frozen bogs or swampy marshlands with their heads poking just above the water's surface, ever watchful for unwary prey.",Linnorm,19
Taiga Yai,"Wearing the visage of taiga giants, taiga yais generally travel in a solitary fashion, always yearning for new experiences and destinations. They are zealous in their love of nature in its purest form and gleefully destroy any established civilizations that they encounter before continuing onwards.",Oni,15
Tallow Ooze,"Pale yellow and smelling of meat, this unnatural, globular monster is composed entirely of rendered animal fat. A tallow ooze typically results from magical mishaps during the creation of enchanted candles or soaps, or while rendering the fat of a magical beast, though occasionally spellcasters create these beings intentionally. A tallow ooze hunts other creatures to subsume them into its own body and absorb their fat. Since tallow is solid at room temperature, tallow oozes must metabolize their own bodies to produce enough heat to remain gelatinous. A tallow ooze that cannot replenish itself with absorbed fat will either consume itself or solidify, though a tallow ooze exposed to too much heat might melt entirely.",Ooze,11
Talos Gadgeteer,"The geniekin called taloses descend primarily from zuhra genies, metal elementals, and other denizens of the Plane of Metal. Many taloses mold their natural talent for metalwork into careers as tinkerers, miners, or smiths, although just as many leverage the luster of precious metals in a quest for fame and fortune. Taloses are among the most metropolitan of geniekin, often born in or drawn to cities of various sizes, especially those with advanced metalworking or technology trades. Metal often needs to be worked to find its form and function, which may explain why many taloses seem to enjoy living among people, if not necessarily socializing with them. They often find themselves stumbling into jobs somewhere along the production line of technology, whether it's mining the raw ore from the earth, working it into wires and gears, or constructing the devices themselves. Some taloses resent and reject the expectations that they fill such roles, but many embrace their fascination with tech, often going on to become expert inventors. Taloses are therefore far more likely than other geniekin to make use of clockwork technology in their communities. Despite having long inhabited Golarion, albeit in small numbers, taloses have only rarely been recognized as geniekin. The largest number of them, and also the largest number whose true nature is known, inhabit Tian Xia. The traditions of metal as an element have lived much longer there. Taloses often find themselves drawn to discussions and study of elemental metal the instant they hear of the concept. Historical records speak of renowned courtiers and diplomats with skin of flawless silver or bronze. In the Ivory Port of Goka, the smiths of the family-owned Dragon's Iron Forge craft their blades and firearms with magnetic techniques handed down from their zuhra sheikha ancestor. A talos gadgeteer is a clockwork tinkerer. When confronted, their preferred tactic is to lure opponents into traps using their lesser explosive mines before attempting to engage directly.",Planar Scion,1
Tantriog,"Wherever exquisite cuisine is consumed, amazing songs are performed, or epic waves crest, there wait tantriogs. With a crab's foreclaws, turtle's shell, and back flippers, tantriogs are among the more unique water elementals. They ply the Boundless Sea constantly seeking new experiences, whether the next big wave to ride, a tasty delicacy to sample, or a piece of art to collect. They crave new sensations and often seek them out at the expense of others. If one possesses rare art, lost lore, or fantastic surfing or cooking skills, a tantriog can be a wonderful companion. They're charming and friendly to those they find interesting, but their interest can be highly precarious, dropped the second someone bores them. Tantriogs may even betray acquaintances if it would give them another interesting story to tell. This makes befriending one a tricky proposition, as nothing can be taken for granted. It's a mystery how tantriogs came to wear their current forms. Some say that, in the earliest days of the elemental planes, tantriogs were assassins of ice and mist who committed a crime so great that they're being punished for it to this day. Others claim tantriogs assumed their shape after losing a bizarre cosmic bet. One of the more popular theories about the tantriog's current form is that in the past, they used to be able to shift shape as easily as water molds to its container. In their endless boredom, they were trying out a variety of shapes when a sudden curse (possibly cast by faydhaans) caused them to lose their ability while transforming from a turtle to a crab, leaving them stuck between the two. It's said that any who can teach a tantriog how to relearn their morphing ability could earn the elemental's undying friendship. Whatever the case, the surest way to anger a tantriog is to ask them about their appearance. Conversely, the surest way to befriend a tantriog is with compliments about their appearance or their skills. Don't be too fawning, though. Tantriogs don't like being tricked or made to look a fool.",,7
Tar Ooze,"When creatures carrying magical items die in a tar pit, the magic mixes with the tar itself. Over centuries, this energy animates the tar into a relentless and horrifying ooze. Tar oozes begin their existence in tar pits, naturally occurring lakes of thick and sticky petroleum. Tar pits make effective traps for animals and humanoids alike, as they're often covered with thin layers of dirt or grass or reflect sunlight in a way that resembles a watering hole. Once a creature steps or falls into the sticky tar of the pit, escape is all but impossible. Slowly, the caught creature—and any other victims lured near by its plaintive cries—sinks into the tar, suffocates, and dies. Magic inherent in a captive creature or carried in powerful magic items carried by the dead remains inside the tar, where it gathers, mixes, and slowly energizes it until it begins to move and seek prey. A tar ooze seeps slowly over the land, catching anything it touches in a sticky embrace and devouring it. Living things consumed by the ooze slowly have their flesh digested, only for the bones and fur to be replaced with blobs of sticky tar. These unnatural zombies eventually crawl away, hungry for flesh. Without a master to give them instructions, these tar zombies often follow the ooze that created them, swarming anyone bold or foolish enough to get in their way.",,10
Tar Zombie Mammoth,"Because their massive size makes them difficult for tar oozes to fully digest, tar zombie mammoths tend to resemble their living forms more closely than other tar zombies. However, this doesn't make them any less malignant than smaller tar zombies.","Zombie, Tar",9
Tar Zombie Predator,"A big predator, like a smilodon or dire wolf, might lurk near a tar pit to pick off helpless creatures. When consumed and returned to unlife by a tar ooze, these tar zombie predators are just as canny and vicious.","Zombie, Tar",7
Tar Zombie Snatcher,Humanoids consumed by a tar ooze become sticky warriors in the tar ooze's mindless procession. Some carry weapons.,"Zombie, Tar",6
Tarn Linnorm,"Although more powerful linnorms exist, the multi-headed tarn linnorm can wreak an awe-inspiring amount of devastation.",Linnorm,20
Tattoo Guardian,"Tattoo guardians are vigilant protectors drawn onto the skin of the individuals they are meant to protect. The creators of tattoo guardians typically animate them as they apply the tattoo using specific rituals and specialized inks, though more obscure rituals can animate a tattoo that's already been applied. Regardless of their animating method, tattoo guardians can temporarily remove themselves from their ward's skin and attack or even interpose themselves between their ward and any dangers. Most tattoo guardians remain on their ward and attack without separating. Tattoo guardians come in a variety of forms, taking the shape of religious symbols, powerful creatures, or more abstract shapes. Magic reinforces the bond between a tattoo guardian and its ward, and the death of the ward also brings about the tattoo guardian's destruction. A guardian that is destroyed while its ward lives reverts to a mundane tattoo—often scarred or otherwise marred. Familial or cultural traditions contribute to the meaning of a tattoo guardian's appearance. In many dwarven cultures, a given family or clan develops their own tattoo patterns and uses these in any tattoo guardians they make. It's especially common for members getting tattooed to ask for a tattoo patterned after one worn by a parent or other ancestor they greatly respect.",,3
Tatzlwyrm,"Tatzlwyrms resemble human-sized snakes with two arms and a dragon's head. Distant relatives of true dragons, tatzlwyrms possess only a meager level of intelligence. They can speak Draconic (with a thick, hissing accent), but their ability to reason is limited and they can't use magic. They do possess a level of cunning, however, and some have been known to build rudimentary traps and even lairs. They are not treasure-hoarders, though, so don't expect to find a tatzlwyrm sitting atop a bed of coins. Some tatzlwyrms have managed to forge working relationships with dragons, though it's a rare occurrence. From time to time, dragons have used them as messengers (because they can speak their language, however crudely), scouts (due to their smaller size), guides (when they're familiar with a particular mountain), and even muscle (harassing foes not worthy of a dragon's direct attention). Tatzlwyrms don't work with kobolds, though—tatzlwyrms eat kobolds. Tatzlwyrms hibernate in cold weather, and when they feel winter approaching they seek out underground lairs, mountain crevices, or even hay lofts. On one notable occasion, townsfolk reported being briefly overrun by tatzlwyrms after a conflict between spellcasters in the nearby hills caused a sudden blizzard. Local scholars still debate whether the cause of the influx was the sudden change in weather or if the creatures were drawn to one of the other magic users staying in town who were part of the same pilgrimage as those doing battle. When confronted, tatzlwyrms are more likely to attack than retreat. Indeed, they sometimes lie in wait on purpose, taking advantage of their scales' natural camouflage and awaiting the chance to unleash their signature move: belching poisonous vapor into an opponent's face. Since this breath attack doesn't have much range, the wyrms usually need to grab their foes first and bring them close to their mouth.",,2
Taunting Skull,Some beheaded are raised with their mental faculties mostly intact. These clever undead often provoke their victims into foolishly giving chase or harming themselves.,Beheaded,5
Tax Collector,"Ledgers and marks, positive and negative flows, and levies and allotments are a tax collector's daily bread. Where coin is gained, from whom it is collected, and to whom is it disbursed are their main concerns; the collector is unconcerned with whether the taxed can afford it or take a loan to make up for any shortfall. However, tax collectors aren't immune to corruption: arrangements can be made, deals discussed, documents altered, or coin misappropriated. When dealing with matters of taxes and finance, the tax collector is a 3rd-level challenge.",Magistrates,-1
Teacher,"The passing of knowledge and traditions from generation to generation is a time-honored occupation. Teachers exist to strengthen their populations with literacy, history, and advanced sciences, but most of all with inspiration. Most teachers provide general knowledge so their students are well rounded, but some are experts or even masters of a single discipline. A teacher typically knows three languages in addition to Common. For academic encounters, a teacher is a 4th-level challenge.",Scholars,-1
Temagyr,"Temagyrs embody the fear of nocturnal hunters—predators that stalk through the dark of night and attack when their prey is most vulnerable. Able to blend in with and step between shadows to surprise victims, temagyrs delight in ambush tactics. An average temagyr is 8 feet long and weighs 500 pounds but moves with unnatural fluidity and grace, the shadows they carry seeming to hang in the air behind them. In combat, a temagyr can take down opponents either with physical attacks or by taking bites out of their enemy's shadow. These shadow wounds, which remain visible unless healed, often perplex Material Plane doctors and investigators; a corpse from a temagyr attack can appear pristine, its tattered shadow the only clue to how it met its untimely fate.",Gorga,1
Tendriculos,"These strange amalgams of plant and fungus with animal tendencies form where the natural world is corrupted by foul magic or frayed planar boundaries. Tendriculoses are instinctive ambush predators who seek out lightly traveled forest paths and lie in wait in the undergrowth. A tendriculos swallows its prey as quickly as possible and lets its paralytic digestive juices finish the meal, while swiftly restoring itself with the nourishment provided by the trapped creature. When collected, neutralized, and refined, the digestive fluids of a tendriculos form a lacquer that retains some of the tendriculos's acid resistance. A tendriculos comes into being with a rudimentary understanding of the Sylvan language, but in some cases it might manifest knowing a different tongue, such as Aklo, Draconic, or even Necril. Regardless, tendriculoses have little patience for chattering from potential meals, though some determined fey and primal spellcasters have been known to form alliances or even closer bonds with tendriculoses. Befriending a tendriculos requires great patience and plentiful food—and these the gifts of food must be alive when handed over. When it has finished feeding and is out of combat, a tendriculos slips into a quiescent state for a full day, one of the few times it is safe to approach. Upon rousing, it seeks the deep forest to regurgitate the less digestible portions of its meal. These remains may contain valuables that survived digestion and indicate that a tendriculos's hunting grounds lie nearby. Tendriculoses dwell in deep woods and jungles. Those too near populated areas soon draw unwanted attention with their ravenous appetites. Well-fed tendriculoses develop fruiting bodies that cast forth millions of spores. Spores that happen to alight on carrion grow into new tendriculoses.",,7
Tenebric Giant,"Necromancers reaching for the greatest heights of experimentation know that creating a new terror requires exacting, careful work at every stage of the process. In the case of the tenebric giant, this process begins with a tomb giant who dies after consuming a dose of several poisons combined with the shadow ash reagent. This creates the right circumstances for a necromancer to raise them as a tenebric giant. They're particularly obedient to the will of the necromancer who created them and are charged full of energy from the Shadow Plane, which grants them new powers and abilities.",,17
Tengu Sneak,"Crow-like humanoids, tengus are a canny and clever people who can be found across all of Golarion. Tengus are used to being minorities and facing suspicion wherever they travel, so by necessity many possess a knack for languages as well as for blades. They live on the fringes of society and tend to flock toward less-than-legal occupations, earning them their reputation for being streetwise and unscrupulous—a label that, in turn, perpetuates the tengus’ oppressive cycle of discrimination and illegitimate work. Although humanoid, tengus have very distinct, birdlike features, and many would say that they resemble crows more than they do humans. They have strong, thick beaks, as well as sharp talons at the ends of their arms and legs. Most of a tengu’s body is covered in small feathers that range in color from dark brown and midnight blue to glossy black, with lighter colors being rare but not unheard of. Like many avian creatures, tengus have hollow bones, making them much lighter than other humanoids of their size, although few tengus possess the wings necessary to fly naturally. A tengu’s speech might be punctuated by quick clucks or throaty cawing, and many tengus practice conversation diligently to rid themselves of these involuntary ticks. Ruf  ing of the feathers and compulsive, jerky movements of the neck are other trademark habits. Tengus reproduce by laying eggs: the average tengu egg is about 11 inches in diameter and 16 inches tall and takes 4 months to hatch. Tengus are a people in diaspora and are almost always found within larger kingdoms and communities of other races. Perhaps because they are more visually distinctive than most other humanoid races, tengus tend to be distrusted and persecuted more often than, for example, elves or dwarves. As a result, tengus tend to gather in close-knit social groups composed of other outcasts and people of uncommon ancestry. Few true tengu communities exist, and those that do are often exiled to ghettos and other forgotten city quarters. From an early age, tengus learn that the world is not a friendly place and that they must look out for themselves.",,2
Tenome,"A tenome resembles an eyeless humanoid with rumpled, pale skin and a single eye embedded in each palm of its cadaverous hands. When they opens their disturbingly wide mouth, this sly, frightful predator's fangs hum and pulse with an eerie drone. Tenomes prefer to stalk urban environments; they often wear hooded cloaks or flowing robes to obscure their monstrous features, posing as beggars or corpses to blend in with society. When they attack, tenomes approach their victim with their palms outstretched, attempting to trap prey with their terrifying gaze. Once they seize their prey, tenomes vibrate their strange teeth rapidly as they feasts, emulsifying the bones into a digestible ooze that they slurps from a wound. Tenomes can be put at a disadvantage while hunting, as their vision is obscured when they have prey grabbed. Because of this, tenomes either wait for lone victims or hunts in packs. Members of these groups work together to secure meals for the entire pack and protect each other from being ambushed while feeding. There are rumors that if tenomes pluck the eyes from their victim and places one in each of the corpse's palms, the slain creature will rise as a new tenome the next nightfall. Even tenomes aren't sure of the truth of this rumor, as none remember their own origins, but they might mutilate the corpses of their victims this way in the hopes of creating a pack mate or to instill terror in those who discover the body.",,4
Teraphant,"Though teraphants may resemble an elephant from afar, teraphants lack the long incisors that mark other pachyderms. Instead, tusk-like horns grow from their forehead. Native to Vudra, teraphants are occasionally found in Jalmeray and Nex, brought as rare gifts for nobles. These placid herbivores' resonant psychic powers warn them against creatures approaching with ill intent. Faced with strong, sustained emotions, teraphants may find themselves responding in kind, which sometimes drive them into a fearsome rage against aggressive foes.",,9
Terotricus,"The legendary terotricus is a massive slime-mold that hails from the Abyss. Its collective consciousness encapsulates entire regions, spreading as far as its ever-growing cloud of spores will take it. Once it has seeped onto the Material Plane from the Abyssal realm, a terotricus’s agenda is to feed on all living creatures, infecting them with its spores, and its presence can spell doom for any in its way. Terotricuses move by rapidly expanding and contracting their slimy “bodies,” which are capable of burrowing through soil, gliding across water, and scrabbling up steep slopes. These behemoths of rot don’t need to travel to see their plans come to fruition, though; their spores easily latch onto demons and other denizens of the Abyss, who in turn bring this blight to the Material Plane when the fiends are summoned. When a terotricus infects a creature with its spores, web-like fungal growths start appearing on the victim’s skin until they cover the entire body, at which point the victim’s mind is also subdued and bent to the terotricus’s will. The terotricus’s favored victims include animals, elves, and fey, though it is happy to infect any creature it can catch. Cults of Treerazer occasionally attempt to make contact with a terotricus, but such acts almost always simply result in a new sect of spore-blighted slaves.",,19

Thanadaemon,"Also known as the deacons of death, thanadaemons represent death via old age. They are among the most patient daemons, and prefer to bide their time to enact far-reaching, decades-long plans rather than fight (though they are still deadly foes). Like the Horseman of Death, they ply the waters of the River Styx in search of wayward souls. Rarely are thanadaemons seen without a trademark oar (which they wield as a bo staff), a tool they use to navigate the river's muck-ridden channels and turbulent rapids.",Daemon,13
Thanatotic Titan,"Thanatotic titans served as assassins in the war against the deities. They learned to sever their targets' divine connections, murdering mortal priests and divine heralds alike. Thanatotic titans were locked away in the Abyss, but some have freed themselves and crept out from the Abyss so they might continue their sprees of murder and mayhem. To this day, they seek out the faithful for slaughter.",Titan,22

Theletos,"Theletoses maintain the balance between fate and free will. A theletos is a roughly spherical mass of crystals from which emerge four limbs, each split at the elbow and ending in three-fingered hands. A pair of crystalline tentacles also emerges from its body. Those who have been damaged by a theletos's tentacles describe a disorienting dilemma as they simultaneously feel forced to make a single choice while also being overwhelmed by the endless options available to choose from. Theletoses are more likely than most aeons to interfere in non-aeon societies, particularly in regions with draconian laws. Their involvement is twofold; a theletos concerns itself with both the freedom of individuals and the laws that restrict these individuals, even (or especially) when the two are in opposition.",Aeon,7

Three-Toed Sloth,"The diminutive three-toed sloth is a solitary, tree-dwelling creature. Possessing a gentle nature and unassuming countenance, it has little to defend itself with other than its surprisingly fearsome climbing claws. These sloths are sometimes used as lookouts by secretive druid enclaves, as the symbiotic algae in their fur makes them difficult to spot in tree canopies, though their slow speed leaves them vulnerable on the ground.",Sloth,-1
Thulgant,"Although they spend most of their time hunting and battling demons for control of the Abyss, thulgants amuse themselves with a variety of diversions, such as maintaining galleries of petrified mortals or building massive, hive-like lairs filled with enslaved minions.

Thunderbird parents carry their newly hatched offspring to hidden mountaintop nests, where the young are struck by their first bolts of lightning and learn the mysteries of the storm.",,11
Thylacine,"A thylacine can be easily mistaken for a dog or jackal, but the defining stripes on their gold-hued backs and unusually wide gaping jaws negate this perception in close encounters. A thylacine is quite vocal, and uses a combination of growls, hisses, and gaping threat-yawns when threatened. An adult thylacine stands 2 feet tall at the shoulder, is 4 feet long (not counting an additional 2 feet of tail) and weighs roughly 50 pounds.The thylacine is a marsupial carnivore. This nocturnal predator typically hunts alone, only occasionally forming small packs. Because of their odd appearance, thylacines have a far harsher reputation than they probably should, playing a sort of bogeyman role in farming communities.",Thylacine,0

Tiddalik,"Tiddaliks are giant, drought-causing monstrosities resembling grossly swollen frogs. They travel through the land, sniffing out water to gorge themselves on. Upon finding a source, the tiddalik submerges itself and begins to drink, and drink, and drink. Over time, it slurps the water down to the very last drop and balloons in size, becoming unable to move at more than an amble. The water sustains the tiddalik for years, while the land suffers a great drought. In fact, the only moisture to be found in any quantity might be the damp divot the tiddalik's great, sloshing body leaves behind as it travels. Desperate locals trying to undo a tiddalik's work are met with the creature's gullet or torrents of water. A tiddalik is lazy and unlikely to start a fight of its own volition or even to chase a fleeing attacker, having little interest in anything but slaking its immense thirst. In its death throes, the tiddalik divulges its water stores, breaking free in a final tide of mass destruction that swamps the surrounding area. Woe betide any unlucky enough to find themselves beset by a tiddalik's gluttony!",,7
Tidehawk,"Tidehawks, avian embodiments of the sea and rain, nest in deep underwater crevasses and glide among waves. They feed mostly on large sea life and rise above the surface during or in the aftermath of a rainstorm to bask in the fresh moisture of the air. Though tidehawks hail from the same mystical family as the legendary phoenix, the two rarely interact due to their different outlooks and elemental affiliations. Phoenixes see tidehawks as flighty and unreliable, while tidehawks view their fiery kin as self-righteous do-gooders who can't resist meddling in mortal affairs. Only particularly evil threats to natural environments can bring them together.",,12

Tikbalang,"Tikbalangs are forest creatures that delight in leading travelers astray. They deceive and mislead with their formidable magic, leaping from tree to tree while laughing, or neighing, uncontrollably. While not malicious, neither are they empathetic to the plight of their victims. They would sooner forget about those whom they have played tricks on and leave them to die than lead them back to their intended path through guilty altruism. A tikbalang's occult magic stems from the esoteric mystery of believing the lie. In the moment of crafting illusions or conjuring extradimensional spaces, the tikbalang themself believes that what they are creating is real. This makes their spells harder to resist, and this same principle also makes them very effective liars. But this readiness to believe also makes them susceptible to deceptions and illusions in turn, and they are particularly vulnerable to mind games. Lone travelers without magic of their own often learn riddles, sleight of hand, or other tricks to defend against a tikbalang's oft-deadly entertainment. Other whispers suggest wearing one's shirt inside-out to confuse the creatures, or passing by a tikbalang's forest quietly to avoid drawing their attention. Unlike most illusionists, tikbalangs can also rely on their physical prowess should the need arise. They have unusually long legs that end in cloven hooves, and they stand as tall as ogres when upright. Skilled climbers and leapers, they are also well known for being master wrestlers, where their long limbs put them at a distinct advantage over their foes. They have elongated faces that, when combined with their well-kempt hair, suggest an equine appearance—although some tikbalangs have saurian or birdlike faces instead.",,9
Titan Centipede,"These colossal, solitary centipedes claim vast hunting grounds.",Centipede,9
Tixitog,"Tixitogs are a species of bizarre aberrations that make their homes in the dens of giant spiders. Immune to poison and able to traverse sticky webs thanks to the thick slime that covers their bodies, tixitogs steal food cocooned in spider lairs and prey on spiders themselves, but they are careful never to kill so many that their food supply runs out. Their favorite meal, however, is the odd adventurer or spelunker who stumbles into their nest. These strange creatures have oblong bodies coated in a viscous and transparent slime, three large black eyes, and eight thick, multi-jointed limbs, four of which are inverted and point upward, allowing the monster to easily crawl on either the ceiling or floor of narrow caverns and squeeze through narrow spaces. Their jaws appear small and tubular when closed but peel apart and stretch to terrifying proportions when opened, as their dozens of pointed teeth part to reveal a freakishly long tongue. A tixitog usually hides from the spiders in the lair it has claimed, not out of fear but to keep the spiders from abandoning the lair and moving elsewhere. When a tixitog emerges from the shadows, most spiders flee from it rather than attack, and the tixitog uses this behavior to direct entire swarms of spiders where it pleases. This is typically bad news for bands of adventurers who find themselves within a tixitog’s lair; in the mass hysteria caused by a skittering swarm of spiders headed straight toward them, spelunkers typically fail to notice the more dangerous threat that follows closely behind.",,3
Tolokand,"Streams run dry. The earth cracks. Green leaves brown and shatter. And the creature walks on. The faceless, unknowable tolokands wander the land, bringing desolation with every footfall—belching poisonous smoke, blighting plant life, cracking the earth asunder, and even staining the ground with their foul blood. They turn habitable places into wastelands, which has earned tolokands the name “waste walkers.” These walking forces of destruction don't make their motives known. They remain unmoved by any pleas or threats levied at them, and they fight off attacks only so that they can return to their grim business. However, they have one consistent tendency: they travel to environments on the brink. A tolokand appears in a land wracked by famine or a natural disaster to give it the last push into oblivion. Tolokands are mercifully few in number. Since they appear so rarely, it's unclear whether there are just a few individuals or several dozen. Clearly, more than one exists, though, because their patterned soles are as distinctive as fingerprints. Often, these smoking footprints are all that remain in a blighted land.",,15
Tomb Giant,"Masters of mausoleums and keepers of crypts, the dread creatures called tomb giants are anathema to all living beings, but especially so to other types of giants. Long ago, so the legends say, tomb giants sold their souls in exchange for unfathomable necromantic powers. With whom they made this foul bargain remains a mystery—if the rumors hold any truth at all. Still, tomb giants' power over undeath remains undeniable, and nearly all of them embrace a fervent passion for necromancy. Tomb giants construct massive gothic settlements in haunted valleys and on forsaken hillsides, far enough away from the societies of smaller people that they remain relatively undisturbed, but close enough that they can raid the graveyards of nearby villages with impunity. Elder tomb giants—those who have animated countless hordes of humanoid zombies and skeletons and yearn for even greater challenges—enjoy the thrill of subduing, slaying, and reanimating their fellow giants. Taiga giants in particular are choice prey to an experienced tomb giant, as their larger cousins make formidable undead guardians and warriors. A tomb giant views its mortal life as only one part of its existence. After death, most tomb giants are themselves reanimated as undead, who then continue to practice their necromantic arts.",Giant,12

Tombstone Troll,"Sometimes, when a troll is regenerating from life-threatening wounds inflicted by necromancy or negative energy, the vile energy takes hold in the troll's supernaturally resilient regeneration. The force that should have killed the troll instead becomes a part of the troll's strange physiology. These trolls are not undead, but the force inside them eats at their bodies and souls, turning them into shrunken mockeries of their former selves. These so-called “tombstone trolls” resemble withered, diminutive trolls, bloated with starvation and obviously sickly. Their teeth, hair, and fingernails rot, fall out, and regenerate every few days in an endless cycle that is both painful to experience and sickening to see. Other trolls shun and despise tombstone trolls, who earn their name from their habit of digging up graves in their search for an easy meal that can't fight back. Tombstone trolls shun confrontation of any kind, especially in areas where their grave-robbing might put them at odds with powerful undead. They often lair underground, safe in their graveyard burrows for days at a time, gradually tunneling through the earth to devour nearby corpses. If the tombstone troll is clever, the surface might not bear any evidence of their presence except for a few divots or soft spots in the soil. Once a tombstone troll has run out of easy pickings in a cemetery, it moves on in the dead of night to find a new hunting ground. If their travel is lengthy or difficult, their hunger might drive them to attack the living.",Troll,1

They appear as the mortals they were in life, horribly disfigured by acts of cruelty. Unable to rest, they haunt the sites of their deaths, doomed to relive their last moments of agony. The toxic psychic residue of their death is so great it spills over, afflicting anyone who meets the tormented's haunted gaze.",,14
Toshigami,"Toshigami are especially powerful kami who protect cherry trees, particularly ones in places where the primeval powers of nature remain strong. The cycle of blossoming, flourishing, and wilting that cherry trees exhibit provides a striking visual metaphor for toshigami, who wield immense powers over growth, decay, and even time. Also known as blossom kami, toshigami have a particular fascination with mortals. Many folk legends tell of toshigami who bestow their blessing unto worthy individuals who fight for just causes. Likewise, it isn't unheard of for toshigami to aid virtuous souls in dire need of healing or restoration. In truth, blossom kami are so rare and enigmatically aloof that few mortals have ever encountered such beings. Decades, even centuries, might pass before a humble village realizes that a toshigami inhabits its beloved cherry tree. The stories persist, however, as they have for ages, leading to a widespread appreciation for cherry trees. The site of a new village might be chosen due to its proximity to an ancient cherry tree, and cherry trees are planted and carefully tended in larger population centers, both for their beauty and out of respect for the blossom kami. Should a toshigami choose one such tree as their ward, so much the better for the entire community.",Kami,15
Totenmaske,"Spawned by the same unnatural and self-destructive obsessions that drove them when they were alive, totenmaskes are the undead remnants of the most self-indulgent and sinful among us. Though unable to sate their perverse desires, these foul undead can drain the very flesh from their victims so as to wrap themselves in a perverse mockery of life that allows them to pursue their base wants. Totenmaskes' specific longings vary—one might be obsessed with food or drink, while another might be vain and desirous of an attractive form to marvel at in a mirror, while yet another could simply long for the scent of blood. Whatever the sensation the totenmaske seeks, it is always a vice taken to extreme, for this sin is what helped condemn it to unlife in the first place. A totenmaske obsessed with food, for example, might find itself assaulting bakeries or breweries, while a vain totenmaske obsessed with glamor could quickly grow bored of each new look and switch its victims out daily, or even hourly.",,7
Tracker,"The forest offers dangerous creatures—whether they walk on four legs or two—a place to hide. Dim light, low brush, and fallen leaves conspire to hide their trails. Given these poor conditions, an unskilled eye might spot a sign or two of a creature's passing, but only a skilled tracker can identify several such signs and discern their relationship to each other, connecting one to the next until they form a trail of prints, scat, fur, feathers, and blood that leads to the quarry's lair.",Foresters,3
Trailgaunt,"Legends warn of trailgaunts—the twitching, rotting corpses of seasoned travelers who became lost on their journeys and died of starvation, thirst, or exposure to the elements. These troubled souls, the tales say, rise at the next sunset as tormented undead, doomed to forever search for the road they lost in life. Always wandering, the trailgaunt treads the ground over and over until its legs wear down to bloodied stumps. Even then, it staggers on, groaning in constant pain. Consumed with agony and a hatred for travelers of all kinds, they prey on those who—like they once did—stray from their path. Lacking feet, a trailgaunt is slow but largely impervious to obstacles in its path, shambling at an equal pace through boggy mires, thick brambles, and desert sands. Yet, these horrors come to a halt at the edge of any well-maintained road, which are the only barriers to their endless wanderings, since they can't willingly tread upon the roads that betrayed them. Because so much of Varisian culture centers around travel, trailgaunts often turn up in their legends. Most depictions of trailgaunts include Varisian clothing, tattoos, or jewelry, but these undead arise around the world, each bearing the trappings of the cultures they lost. Further north, along the Crown of the World, trailgaunts wail amid howling winds, shivering as they shamble through the snow. Along Garund's Golden Road, trailgaunts are common sights in the trackless desert wastes, where even an experienced traveler can easily lose their way. To the south, travelers lost in the Mwangi Expanse who starve before being eaten themselves become damp, mossy trailgaunts. While most travelers who hear a trailgaunt's wail know to run fast and far, some adventurers intentionally seek out these undead. Few trailgaunts perish with no belongings at all, and many poor souls doomed to this fate were once merchants or adventurers who carried substantial wealth and magical treasure—some of which still might be on their person. It never occurs to these treasure seekers that in their pursuit of such riches they might become trailgaunts themselves.",,3
Trapjaw Tangle,"Sometimes the best intentions result in dire consequences and even a successful project can turn into an unending nightmare. Such is the grim tale of the first trapjaw tangles. These mechanical swarms were initially created as a solution to the pestilence of mutated rodents that plagued Alkenstar. These mobile rat traps, bound together by a magical matrix of occult energy, were programmed to wait in ambush or chase down their prey. The first trapjaw tangles proved effective and their creators were well rewarded for their ingenious designs. Soon trapjaw tangles were deployed throughout Alkenstar, Martel, and the Gunworks. Waves of them would be sent to roam into the Spellscar Desert, and the ever-present vermin were quickly forgotten. Then disaster struck. A rogue wave of magical energy washed over an airship that carried a trapjaw tangle in its hold. The magical affliction scrambled the tangle's programming and gave the swarm just enough intellect to send it on a red frenzy through the ship. When the airship crashed into the outskirts of Alkenstar, its crew perished but the infected tangle survived to infect every trapjaw it met with the same deadly scrambling of magic. Now, trapjaw tangles are an even greater menace to society than the vermin they were originally designed to eradicate.",,5
Triceratops,"Triceratopses are muscular quadrupeds with powerful but short legs, thick necks, and heads crowned by a wide, bony frill. Though they bear a large horn on their snout and one on each brow, these dinosaurs are herbivores and use these bony protrusions only to defend themselves from attackers or in dramatic clashes against other triceratopses for grazing territory or mates. Short-tempered and obstinate, triceratopses are unlikely to back down from a fight unless they are hopelessly outmatched, and the creatures are known to fight to the death for no apparent reason beyond stubbornness. Triceratopses often serve as mounts for lizardfolk, orcs, and giants, who ride comfortably behind the dinosaurs’ protective bone frills. A triceratops is 30 feet long and weighs as much as 10 tons. Triceratopses are surely the most well-known of the dinosaurs known as ceratopids, but many others exist. For example, the smaller styracosauruses have only one horn but several horn-like protrusions on their frills.",Dinosaur,8
Trilobite,"Trilobites have segmented, chitinous bodies that armor them but provide enough flexibility for them to roll up and protect their vulnerable undersides from attack. Instead of jaws, trilobites have specialized structures called gnathobases at the base of some of their legs. These serrated and jagged structures grind and masticate any prey the trilobite latches onto, enabling the creatures to feed on anything from hard-shelled clams to soft-bodied creatures. While not particularly fast on their own, they can employ scuttling bursts of speed to dart into ocean silt or seaweed beds to escape predators. Oceanic wizards of many types employ trilobites as familiars. In addition to trilobites' durability, their ubiquity means they make capable spies for their masters as they travel unnoticed throughout the depths.",Trilobite,-1
Trilobite Swarm,"Trilobites typically live in close proximity to others of their kind. On rare occasions, particularly when the most common prey around is larger than what a single trilobite can take down, they form swarms that seem to actively cooperate with each other. These swarms latch onto their prey, and the combined efforts of so many trilobites at once make escape difficult.",Trilobite,3
Triton,"While sometimes understandably mistaken for merfolk—both species live underwater and have a blend of features from both humans and fish—tritons have two legs instead of a tail. This gives tritons the ability to operate on land, though they are neither as comfortable nor as skilled above water as below. The arms and legs of a triton feature fins that assist in swimming, and their entire body is covered in fine scales that range in color from silver to cerulean blue to seaweed green. Their amphibious nature shows in the webbing between the digits of their feet and hands, as well as the fact that they have both gills and a human-shaped nose and mouth. Triton hair grows in wide strands like seagrass, commonly green in shade but in some cases blue or white. Their eyes range in color from sea blue to golden. Many tritons see themselves as defenders of the deep, dedicating their lives to protecting the inhabitants of the seas from evil creatures and intruders—whether they come from underwater or the surface world. Primary among triton foes are sea devils and alghollthu, both of whom have amphibious forces that tritons have had to fight underwater and on land. In their quest to fight underwater evil, tritons sometimes ally with dolphins and sea turtles (both of which make excellent mounts), water elemental, and sometimes even sharks and sea serpents. Tritons can summon such allies using a conch shell as a trumpet. When it comes to other intelligent undersea species, however, tritons take pride in their self-sufficiency, rarely trading with other underwater peoples such as merfolk, and even more rarely forming established alliances. Tritons live in natural-grown villages on the sea floor, forging dwellings out of colorful coral reefs, in rift valleys heated by volcanic activity, and even in underwater canyons— though they avoid settling in extreme depths due to the risk of encountering krakens or worse. They like to decorate their homes with aquatic plants, bioluminescent fish, and attractive trinkets recovered from shipwrecks.",,2
Triumph Siktempora,"Triumph siktemporas embody the emotional satisfaction of overcoming a task that took up much of a creature's mind, be it taking an apple seed from between one's teeth or winning a war. They exult in every victory they attain; however, they value only those successes won fairly not only abiding by the established rules of a competition but also enforcing those rules mercilessly upon other competitors. These siktemporas appear as small humanoids with four muscular arms and digitigrade legs. They take great joy in draping themselves in golden clothes and medals that commemorate the countless victories which spawned them, and their faces bear proud, dazzling smiles and expressions of success—but these features never move.",Siktempora,14
Troll,"Common trolls are dim-witted, gangly giants who stalk the fringes of civilization. They rely on their incredible strength to overpower foes with their vicious claws and toothy maws. A troll’s endless hunger drives it to consume all variety of living creatures, and it is their ravenous eating habits that fuel trolls’ legendary regenerative abilities. Trolls stand anywhere from 12 to 16 feet tall, though they prefer to hunch for comfort and to lull foes into a false sense of security.",Troll,5
Troll King,"Some trolls have learned the skills necessary to survive well beyond the typical life expectancy for their kind and rally others to follow their lead. These champions develop a number of talents that make them worthy leaders and potent hunters—namely their abilities to willingly boost the rate of their regeneration and to shake off the acid and fire that would hinder it, not to mention a bestial roar that can send would-be predators scurrying off. Troll kings possess a cunning far beyond their younger kin— they know to keep their allies close, and their enemies even closer. If a troll king so much as suspects that one of its followers is plotting to usurp it, retribution is swift and fatal.",Troll,10
Trollhound,"Trollhounds are squat, slavering beasts akin to trolls in canine form. Requiring vast quantities of meat to fuel their regenerative metabolisms, packs of wild trollhounds prowl the foothills of regions where trolls dwell, their voracious hunger driving them to slaughter and consume any prey they encounter. In some regions, trolls breed trollhounds as pets, utilizing the trollhounds' keen sense of smell to aid in the hunt. Covered in fetid, weeping sores, trollhounds are carriers of a debilitating contagion known as bloodfire fever. Creatures that contract the disease through the bite of a trollhound experience deep internal pain, as if their blood were on fire. Additional symptoms include loss of muscle coordination, pus-filled blisters, and overall lethargy and fatigue. Other than suffering from skin irritation, both trolls and trollhounds are immune to the major effects of the disease. Trollhounds are fearless on the hunt and in combat, relying on their ability to regenerate to carry them through. Not even the threat of fire is enough to repel them, as the beasts don't recognize the danger it represents. Nevertheless, fire is one of the most effective tools in combating trollhounds; canny hunters know to burn every last remnant of a supposedly slain trollhound, for their regenerative powers are potent indeed. While trolls themselves have had great success in domesticating, training, and even befriending trollhounds, the same cannot be said for other would-be masters. Whether impeded by constant exposure to trollhounds' diseased slobber, their ravenous hunger that never seems to be fully sated, or simply their foul personality and quick-to-bite temperament, most attempts to use trollhounds in place of more reliable guardians end in pain, misery, and a pack of feral trollhounds escaping into the hinterlands. Left to their own devices, a pack of escaped trollhounds can breed relatively quickly, and it can take less than a year for a small pack to multiply into a significant threat to the countryside. Best to leave the trollhounds to the trolls, as they say!",,3

Trumpet Archon,"Trumpet archons are messengers, emissaries, and storytellers—embodiments of the virtue of kindness. They use stories and allegories to prevent bloodshed, and among all archons they are the most likely to work together with angels, perhaps leading to the similarities in their forms. When diplomacy is impossible, trumpet archons rally the righteous to battle—one reassuring glance from a trumpet archon is often all it takes to instill a shaken ally with resounding courage once again.",Archon,14
Tupilaq,"A tupilaq is an artistically crafted construct carved from animal bones (typically whale or walrus) and imbued with the express purpose of eviscerating its creator's enemies. A tupilaq manifests from hateful magic—a thing that can be created only by someone who believes they were grievously wronged. When a terrible, unforgivable crime is committed against someone with great skill at carving and who has knowledge of the proper ritual, the aggrieved can channel their grief and hate through whispered incantations to bring a tupilaq to life. Sadly, the same emotions used to create a tupilaq often lead to even greater tragedies. Functionally immortal but built for vengeance a tupilaq lacks the reason or discernment to do anything other than pursue the goal imbued by its creator. A wish to utterly destroy an enemy can lead a tupilaq to slaughter an entire clan or settlement, killing until it has slain everyone even remotely related to the original offender. There are many stories where a tupilaq ends up causing more tragedy for its creator than the crime that precipitated its creation. The most common tales feature the tupilaq eventually murdering its creator's spouse or family members due to a distant relationship to the original target that no one knew about. Tupilaqs' animating energies aren't tied to their original functions, and the creatures typically long outlast their creators, their victims, and often any who recall the reason for their creation. They might fall into a sort of hibernation once they've achieved immediate vengeance, but they frequently reawaken to continue their rampage against unsuspecting targets ignorant of their involvement. Spellcasters might occasionally summon these constructs. Summoned tupilaqs, hauled unceremoniously from their vengeance, become near-frenzied combatants, unleashing every offensive ability in their arsenal to break free. These reactions aren't strategic or considered, but an instinctual, almost programmed need to return to their true purpose. Conjurers should be wary about tupilaqs employing spells that might be turned against their summoners, such as a fireball spell “accidentally” placed such that it incinerates the spellcaster and returns these creatures from whence they came.",,7
Twigjack,"Maladjusted forest denizens, twigjacks form from the cruel and prankish combination of fey and the very woods in which they reside. A twigjack's body is made up of prickly brambles woven with vines. Shaggy, mossy growth, not unlike hair, tops a twigjack's head. Its mouth is just a canyon of splintered and broken sticks bisecting its face. Leaves and sprigs of new growth randomly sprout from the creature's body. Many dense forests on Golarion have at least a handful of twigjacks living in the undergrowth. While truculent and violent, twigjacks care deeply for what they consider to be their forests. These creatures harass outsiders who delve deep into their wooded domains, forcing back even the most determined explorers, foresters, and travelers, especially when those intruders cut roads through the forest. However, they are not terribly territorial when it comes to other forest creatures. When sylvan creatures, especially fey, rally against an outside threat, twigjacks in the area eagerly arrive to fight, even if they were not invited. Less seasoned travelers who encounter twigjacks in their canopied homes often mistake them for leshys, a tendency that frustrates twigjacks, as they have a low opinion of such creatures. More broadly, twigjacks resent being considered mere animated plants at all. Rather, they embrace their fey heritage—often to a foolish end. Twigjacks go out of their way to ingratiate themselves to the fey creatures they live among. Several popular comic songs weave the tale of a twigjack attempting to woo a powerful and graceful dryad, only to be comically disgraced after many loutish attempts. Many fey seem embarrassed by these strange cousins, but some spriggans, quicklings, and redcaps harness the twigjacks' violent urges and disruptive behavior for their own purposes. While twigjacks are fey, and as such are often found in the First World, it's somewhat curious that those twigjacks who find religion only rarely turn to the Eldest of the First World. Instead, twigjacks tend to worship false deities of their own design: figures spotted in tangles of tree branches, clots of undergrowth, or other hidden nooks in the natural world. These religions are always highly localized, and while these faiths do not support clerics, they often inspire zealous crusades against non-fey.",,3
Twins of Rowan,"Twins of rowan are among the most powerful elementals on the Plane of Wood, specially crafted to patrol a wide range of wilderness and maintain the plane's carefully constructed order. Despite having two heads and torsos, each twins of rowan is a singular creature; like all wood elementals, their true consciousness is not in their heads but in the roots, and their true body is the trunk of the tree, not the extended limbs.","Elemental, Wood",13
Two-Headed Troll,"Two-headed trolls are savage, dual-minded monsters with an unquenchable thirst for bloodshed, and dread tales of their ravenous appetites are whispered of in homesteads throughout the lands of the Inner Sea. Indeed, it is a custom for parents to invoke the two-headed troll as a warning to misbehaving children. “Finish your chores,” a parent might say to a stubborn child, “or a two-headed troll will snatch you away at night and swallow you whole!” It's unclear why such a morbid tradition gained traction with parents, but it's an undeniable fact that two-headed trolls have an appetite for “nibbles”—creatures small enough to devour with one bite. Mature two-headed trolls stand 13 feet in height, weighing roughly 1,700 pounds. Unlike common trolls, two-headed trolls share the upright gait of their ettin ancestry and do not walk hunched over.",Troll,8
Tylosaurus,"Though large in size—sometimes exceeding 40 feet—tylosauruses have sleek bodies and long, narrow snouts. Few creatures compete with them in their environment, as most other aquatic giants reside in deeper water.",Mosasaur,8
Tyrannosaurus,"Widely regarded as the king of the dinosaurs, the tyrannosaurus is a massive predator with a wide mouth filled with viciously sharp teeth. Thundering beasts of fury and hunger, tyrannosauruses are bold and fearless carnivores that eagerly bite off great hunks of large prey and swallow smaller prey—such as most humanoids—in a single gulp. Although they can subsist on carrion, tyrannosaurs prefer live prey. Tyrannosauruses stand on two wide, powerful hind legs that allow them to run quickly, and their thick tails provide them with exceptional balance. Although a their small forelimbs are of little use other than to hold prey in place while the predators tear at their victim’s flesh with their fearsome jaws, even these forelimbs bear sharp claws several inches long. As fearsome as tyrannosauruses are alone, they sometimes hunt in packs to take down massive prey. Only the most powerful creatures can successfully train tyrannosauruses, and even then, only when they can provide the ravenous beasts with a steady diet of meat. Some tribes of giants, particularly cyclopes or more obscure denizens of primeval lands, have even trained tyrannosauruses as mounts or beasts of war. In other places, xulgaths feed these prisoners to these mighty dinosaurs as part of executions or ritual sacrifices. Some xulgath cults even revere tyrannosaurs as incarnations of their violent demonic demigods. For their part, tyrannosaurs who have grown used to having their meals provided in this manner are remarkably well-behaved toward their feeders and keepers. Tyrannosauruses are 50 feet long and weigh 7 tons or more.. Other variants of the tyrannosaurs include slightly smaller dinosaurs such as the allosaurus, or even larger dinosaurs like the ravenous giganotosaurus. Even the smallest tyrannosaurs, such as the nanotyrannus, are never smaller than Large in size, yet despite this smaller stature, they are no less ferocious, and those who would assume that a nanotyrannus is ""safer"" to train would do well to think again!",Dinosaur,10

Tzitzimitl,"Due to their affinity for darkness and apocalyptic terror, tzitzimitls are widely feared as harbingers of death and destruction. A solar eclipse marks their arrivals, and they draw strange powers of darkness and electricity from these phenomena. Some sages believe tzitzimitls to be instruments of the gods, called down to destroy worlds whose times have come, while others claim they're the undead remains of stranded exiles from a far-off civilization of spacefaring giants. The legends that include them are ancient and fragmented, but some tell of tzitzimitls being defeated by great heroes and sealed away—though these tales imply that the enormous undead now lie buried and waiting, soon to rampage again should their tombs be breached.",,19
Umasi,"Tales tell of strange humanoids who harvest appendages and organs from other creatures to graft onto their own perpetually decaying bodies. These stories are encountered more often than their subject, however. A reclusive people, umasi live deep in remote jungles, largely isolated from other societies. Despite not being undead, umasi can't heal naturally or via magic. Instead, they must harvest appendages and organs from the living to perpetuate their own lives. These modifications require special techniques, obscure rituals, and often the assistance of other umasi. Shorter rituals make quick repairs to wounded flesh— even consuming a nutrient-rich organ of a recently slain creature can provide quick rejuvenation—while more extensive changes require a full day's work. Because of the nature of their existences, no one single form remains common to umasi. Many graft any number of arms or legs of various sizes on their bodies, while others are conglomerations of exotic beasts, other humanoids, and whatever creatures they've hunted or scavenged. However, all umasi remain vaguely humanoid in shape. An umasi with additional arms can hold or wield more items at once, while additional legs or other limbs might grant increased Speed or new types of Speed. Concepts such as gender, ethnicity, and even recognizing someone based on their appearance are irrelevant to umasi. Instead, they value age and experience and identify themselves with iconic adornments or speech patterns. Despite their morbid nature, umasi are rarely at odds with living creatures. These opportunistic hunters value their self-preservation, but use fast-acting nonlethal poisons to subdue their targets for safe and minimally destructive harvesting. Few umasi harbor malice toward the living, but some possess a streak of self-loathing and search for powerful magics that might break whatever curse binds them to their current state. Rarely, an umasi finds some strange form of acceptance on the fringes of a remote community where their skills at medicine carry more weight than fear of their strange appearances.",,6
Umbraex,"An umbraex appears at first glance to be a massive, majestic bird, much like a phoenix. Instead of compassion and warmth, however, it seethes with cold and hate. The umbraex is among the largest of the nihilistic undead called darvakkas.",Darvakka,21
Umonlee,"Those who dwell in the coldest climates of Golarion tell of a brutal beast that swims through the ice and snow and can devastate entire villages in minutes. Ancient Erutaki who made their homes in the frozen polar expanse called the Crown of the World named this monster the umonlee. Umonlees are bestial predators who constantly hunt, rarely resting in service of a hunger that is never fully sated. Despite this animalistic drive, umonlees are semi-intelligent creatures who often select and stalk their prey. However, they are not terribly bright and often keep their hunting grounds in sparsely-trafficked areas. It is rare for an umonlee to attack a village, but one might attack a sparse group, such as a hunting or scouting party. Many caravans traversing the Path of Aganhei—the trade route between the continents of Avistan and Tian Xia that crosses the Crown of the World—have had their expeditions abruptly ended by an encounter with one of these monstrosities. Those who study monsters posit that umonlees are related to chuuls, as the creatures exhibit some similarities. Both are semi-intelligent, crustacean predators that use ambush tactics to kill and eat their prey. Even though they can talk, umonlees typically only speak Aklo, which also gives credence to this theory. This would also lend to the theory that chuuls are products of alghollthu manipulation, meaning that umonlees are also the results of these alien designs. However, the fact that these creatures aren't evil argues well against such a theory.",,15
Undine Hydromancer,"Undines are infused with elemental water—the churning power of the briny deep flows through them. These planar scions are often athletic and lithe, but they are easily distracted by auditory sensations because of how much louder and clearer sound rings above the waves. Undines are perhaps the most settled of all geniekin, often forming communities along the coast or even on the water itself. In the latter case, they prefer to settle in ship-towns that sometimes number dozens of vessels in all shapes and sizes. The undines who fill these communities are similarly diverse, bringing aspects of multiple cultures together to form one whole. Ship-towns are permanent, but fluid—they grow, recede, and migrate constantly as undine families add their ships to or remove them from the flotilla. An undine town like this may remain at sea for years, its residents coming ashore only on rare occasions to collect wood for cookfires or to repair their homes. The paradoxically ever-shifting permanence of these communities reflects the undine virtues of adaptability and freedom, while also maintaining the prime importance of the community. Undine hydromancers are quite valued on these floating settlements, if only for their ability to create fresh drinking water while adrift on the sea.",Geniekin,1
Unfeeling Empath,"The soul of a gnome killed by tragedy sometimes becomes so entangled in conflicting emotions that it becomes trapped and reanimates its own corpse. Known as unfeeling empaths, these undead wander in search of others' emotions. When they find thinking prey, they relentlessly goad that creature to elicit and consume their feelings. Though initially harmless, feeding drives an unfeeling empath into an expressive frenzy as they overload the victim's mind, resuming their senses only after their prey is dead.",,2
Unicorn,"Symbols of grace and purity, unicorns resemble proud and noble horses. They are typically pure white of coat, but they are best known for the single, delicate horn that extends from the center of their forehead. While unicorns often serve as protectors of unspoiled wilderness and sacred places, they are themselves highly sought after for their horns, which are said to possess potent magical properties. To many, the mere idea of hunting such a magnificent creature in the hopes of severing its horn is utterly reprehensible. Indeed, a de-horned unicorn is a sorry sight, and few such unicorns survive much longer in the wild. Unicorns are found almost exclusively in remote, unsullied areas of wilderness. Sometimes associated with good-aligned deities, other times associated with nature and the fey, unicorns are always known for their righteousness and nobility. They are wary, at best, of most humanoid creatures, due in large part for poachers’ tendency to hunt them for their horns, but unicorns are often rumored to have a weakness for those who are pure of both heart and spirit. Despite some tales, unicorns are equally likely to recognize purity in young men as in young women.",,3

Unrisen,"An unrisen is a mangled conglomeration of splintered bones, decaying organs, and rotting flesh, created when a ritual such as resurrect goes catastrophically wrong. Immense care must be taken, for if the ritual is a critical failure, an unrisen can be the result—as many a ritualist has learned to their horror. Unrisen are barely intelligent, aware only of the agony constantly inflicted by their flawed creation and their resentment for the living. They tend to attack the casters involved in the botched ritual first before lashing out at everyone else around them. Though an unrisen's twisted form is unrecognizable as the intended target of the resurrection, its wordless howls are often disturbingly similar to the deceased's voice. If an unrisen is destroyed before it can rise again, it's reduced to a handful of metallic blue-green salts referred to as essential salts.",,11

Valkyries are humanoid individuals of impressive physical stature who seek the most epic battles and legendary conflicts so that they can lay claim to the souls of the world's greatest warriors. The valkyries transform these souls into the implacable immortals known as einherjar. Valkyries most often serve gods of battle and war, though a valkyrie might pledge their service to any deity they consider worthy. Gorum is particularly well known for having valkyrie and einherjar servants, though he isn't the only such deity. Besmara also has valkyrie servitors, and many stories of “ghost ships” actually reference accounts of encounters with ships manned by einherjar crews devoted to the Pirate Queen.",,12
Vampire Bat Swarm,"Although the typical vampire bat has a wingspan of 7 inches and doesn’t pose a significant threat to larger prey alone (and indeed, these blood-drinkers can feed without their sleeping victims ever noticing), some unusually aggressive species of these bats hunt in deadly swarms.

Vampiric Mist,"Though they're often mistaken for vampires in gaseous form or an unusual type of air elemental, vampiric mists are in fact strange aberrant life-forms. With an amorphous body that consists as much of fluid as it does of air, these creatures dwell in swamps or moist underground regions where their vulnerability to heat isn't as much of a concern. Still, they prefer to lair near the fringes of such areas, as a vampiric mist needs a constant supply of fresh blood for sustenance. While blood drawn from animals is just as nutritious as blood from anything else, these sadistic monsters vastly prefer the flavor of blood drawn from thinking creatures. Like will-o'-wisps, vampiric mists find that fear flavors the blood, though they gain no particular advantage by feeding on the frightened. Although somewhat intelligent, vampiric mists do not form societies. They sometimes group into small gangs, but even then they show little interest in working together. Vampiric mists spend most of their time seeking prey—a pursuit they approach with great creativity. The mists' propensity for taking on vague, skeletal forms of the creatures whose blood they drink further adds to their mystique and fuels rumors that they have connections to the undead. Indeed, many vampiric mists enjoy using this common misconception to their advantage, leading foes to apply foolish tactics—such as tricking spellcasters into attempting to use positive energy against them as if they were undead monsters.",,3
Vanara Disciple,"Vanara culture prizes order and discipline, leading to many vanaras studying monastic practices. They also value compassion, kindness, and community, whether that community is their own or one they're visiting. Most vanaras are quick to offer aid to those in distress and rarely hesitate in the face of evil, no matter the danger it presents.

Though powerful, they're the least of the darvakkas, and the most likely to submit to a master, either another of their kind or a mortal with a reputation for being especially murderous and destructive. Vanyvers agree to follow their masters as a temporary means of maximizing the death and destruction they can enact but will quickly turn on any master they feel falters in this goal.",Darvakka,13
Vaspercham,"The darkly intelligent vaspercham, an aquatic horror who delights in violence and destruction, lurks in the shallows near shorelines. Once a vaspercham settles on a new home, they stubbornly stay there, regardless of any communities dwelling nearby. A vaspercham's physical might and magic-warping abilities make them incredibly hard to dislodge once entrenched, and many seaside communities have relocated after a vaspercham came calling. The monster responds only to strength, so one must best a vaspercham in combat to gain their begrudging cooperation.

Vaultbreaker Ooze,"Though many oozes hunt among the dreary confines of underground caverns, dungeons, and abandoned ruins, others seek to quell their hunger in areas well-trafficked by civilized creatures. The aptly named vaultbreaker oozes exhibit a mindless compulsion to feed on and digest precious metals. When near precious metals, the ichor exuded from their metallic plasm tarnishes black and forms small, jagged crystals that dot the oozes' surface. Like a strange biological compass, these crystals point vaultbreaker oozes to their next meal. Though mindless, these strange oozes exhibit an innate instinct for picking and bypassing locks to reach their meals by inserting a gelatinous pseudopod into a keyhole and then hardening the appendage into solid metal, forming a tool similar to a skeleton key. Vaultbreaker oozes can often be found in cities where tectonic instability has created fissures and cracks, allowing them to infiltrate basements, vaults, and underground chambers that may contain treasure. When rumors of vaultbreaker ooze sightings surface, banker consortiums, Abadaran priests, and even local thieves guilds offer hefty sums to have the dangerous oozes destroyed—though some might instead offer a bounty for their capture.",Ooze,6

Casters must take care, however, to not let them germinate in the Universe; they're a highly invasive species that can devour an entire forest within a decade. The healing and nourishing food that grows from vegetable lambs is appealing for adventurers and sedentary magical scholars alike.

These manipulators of mind and body alike lead their species in the open, using their ability to change form to walk among and deceive humans and other sapient species. Many veiled masters are even more powerful than the typical specimen presented here and can use a wide range of arcane or occult spells and rituals. While veiled masters command significant combat prowess and impressive magical skills, the greatest danger they pose to others is their uncanny ability to infiltrate into societies much different than their own. The most paranoid of adventurers and conspiracy scholars worry that every major city has been infested by secret cabals of vidileths, while others dismiss this as hogwash and fearmongering. The truth is likely somewhere in between, but it doesn’t take many veiled masters pulling the strings behind the scenes to wreak havoc upon an entire nation!",Alghollthu,14
Veldenar,"Some dangers lurking within the Endless Sky can doom prey before they even realize it; such are the ambush tactics of the 20-foot-tall elementals known as veldenars. Their inherent invisibility and pale, almost translucent forms make them among the most deadly creatures to call the Plane of Air home. Veldenars resemble amphibians from the Universe, albeit with myriad red eyes and an affinity for cold. Hunting along the edges of eternal storms, the event horizons of dead zones, and the banks of sky streams, veldenars prey on the lesser denizens of their home plane. They can often be found using their natural buoyancy to drift among the large chunks of magical ice that crossed onto the Plane of Air from its former border with the Plane of Water. There, they extend their tongues to trap unwary flying insects or adventurers who might happen to float by. Their multiple eyes keep watch for their next meal even while devouring current prey. The intense cold of a veldenar's stomach rapidly incapacitates its victims, allowing the predator to focus on returning to invisibility and finding a secluded spot to digest. Victims who escape the veldenar's stomach often feel chilled to the bone for days. Veldenars aren't discerning about who or what they inhale. As a result, kinds of scrap can collect in their stomachs, especially inorganic material. Those hunting veldenars often wait until the elemental needs to regurgitate debris, as this is one of the few times a veldenar can be caught in a compromising position, unable to capture anything due to their clogged esophagus.",,11
Velociraptor,"A smaller cousin of the deinonychus, the velociraptor is a swift, cunning pack hunter. It has no fear of larger creatures, and a group of these dinosaurs won’t hesitate to attack creatures the size of a horse. Velociraptors are social animals, and tend to live in groups of up to a dozen other velociraptors. They have manes of feathery plumage that extend down their backs and along the sides of their arms, legs, and tail, while their underbellies and flanks are scaly. These feathers allow them to blend into their natural terrains with ease, but when excited, attempting to intimidate, or seeking a mate, a velociraptor can puff and frill this plumage to expose much brighter colors normally covered by the longer feathers. A typical velociraptor is 1-1/2 feet tall, 7 feet long, and weighs 35 pounds.",Dinosaur,1
Veranallia,"Veranallias represent the freedom of life to grow, change, and adapt. They rarely interact directly with non-azatas, as most other beings find their nature hard to comprehend, but those who secure their aid find them powerful allies. The lower half of a veranallia's body is made of vegetation that constantly repeats a dizzying cycle of sprouting, blooming, thriving, and wilting. The upper half of their body appears as that of a humanoid of any gender—it is rare for a veranallia to remain consistent in their gender for more than a few seasons at a time.Veranallias transform the landscape in their wake, bringing creation and destruction alike. The world around them overflows with an abundance of vegetation, with plenty of food for nearby animals, and when they bring destruction, they do so without cruelty, as it is sometimes necessary to make room for new life. They trigger forest fires in woodlands before dry brush piles up to dangerous levels, and bring bitter winters to areas plagued with parasites that thrive in hot weather.",Azata,20
Verdurous Ooze,"Verdurous oozes are found in temperate forests, warm jungles, or other places where plant life grows in abundance. Unlike many types of oozes, verdurous oozes are not particularly good climbers and have been known to get trapped in natural or artificial chasms. Warlords and wizards sometimes make use of that fact and keep verdurous oozes as guardians in pits around the walls of their fortresses or towers.",Ooze,6
Vermlek,"Vermleks, also called worm demons, manifest from the souls of mortals who desecrated the dead, such as grave robbers or necromancers. These fiends take their violations to a new extreme, using their demonic powers to horrifically core their living victims and don the flesh-husk that remains.In its natural form, a vermlek resembles an oversized pinkish worm with four long tails that end in writhing fibrils. Its mouth splits into four segments like a profane tulip lined with rows of dozens of pointed teeth. More often than not, however, these fiends are encountered only after they have crawled into the body of a dead humanoid and made the hollowed-out flesh their temporary host. Vermleks use their powers of deception and disguise to infiltrate mortal settlements and influence unwitting acquaintances of the bodies they wear. Particularly intelligent or conniving vermleks might even reach stations of real power within the ranks of an army or government, at which point exposure of their true form can wreak havoc among the populace they have so thoroughly duped.

Experienced emergents are cannier than their newly risen kin, stalking their chosen victims and being sure to abduct, kill, or render their victims comatose after draining their memories to ensure no witnesses remain to reveal the presence of a vetalarana.","Vampire, Vetalarana",8
Vetalarana Manipulator,"A vetalarana manipulator is a gifted strategist, empowered by the memories, thoughts, and talents the manipulator has drained from countless victims and honed by centuries of survival. Certain of their own superiority, manipulators twist free-willed individuals for their own ends as easily as they control their comatose puppets.","Vampire, Vetalarana",11
Vexgit,"These gremlins are covered head-to-toe by a crustacean-like exoskeleton that clacks and rattles whenever a vexgit moves. They delight in sabotaging the works of other creatures, often turning these works into dangerous traps. An individual vexgit might jam a door lock, loosen the wheels on a carriage, or remove nails from a boat hull. Buildings infested by vexgits become filled with traps like portcullises descending suddenly, water pipes exploding violently, and clock towers disgorging an avalanches of gears. Aware of their own physical weakness, vexgits carry hammers and other tools to leverage pieces apart or smash whatever they're unable to disassemble. Indeed, a hammer sized for a human becomes a maul in the tiny hands of a vexgit. Vexgit infestations range from one to a score. Larger groups are often led by a more powerful vexgit with additional skill in thievery or primal magic. Trained giant rats, vipers, and rat swarms are common in vexgit lairs.",Gremlin,1
Vilderavn,"In their true form, a vilderavn is a great raven with a wingspan of 6–8 feet. Adaptable shapeshifters, they can change to the fighting forms of a snarling wolf, a hybrid of both wolf and raven, and a tall humanoid in black armor with a massive greatsword. More sinister is their ability to assume a humanoid guise suited to insinuate themselves into the retinues of boastful mortal rulers. With historical knowledge and clever rumor-mongering, they goad the proud into squabbles, feuds, and ultimately wars. The vilderavn stays at the ruler's side until victory is within grasp, the war almost won, then exacts the cruel stroke of betrayal. Their magic turns the mortals against each other, and the vilderavn's sword falls swiftly.",Vilderavn,16
Vilderavn Herald,"In its true form, a vilderavn herald is a human-sized raven. Its ability to assume a humanoid guise suits it to insinuate itself into the retinue of a mortal ruler or to travel without too much concern, but more often these deadly fey directly serve more powerful rulers, such as the Eldest.",Vilderavn,19
Vincuvicar,"Prison keepers among velstracs, vincuvicar velstracs thrive on depriving others of freedom.",Velstrac,18
Vine Leshy,"Irrepressible vine leshys love to explore and collect tales to share. They're curious without being reckless. Other cultures interest them greatly, and they can build friendships quickly as they trade stories with traveling companions. They also feel a pull toward protection, much like other leshys. Vine leshys, though, tend to protect a ward for only a brief period of danger before the leshy's wanderlust drives them onward into the unknown.",Leshy,0
Violet Fungus,"At a glance, a violet fungus might seem to be little more than an unsightly and sickeningly purple mushroom of unusual size. Only once one draws closer— once whip-like tentacles dripping with flesh-rotting venom slither out from the fungus's cratered cap—does the terrifying truth of this carnivorous toadstool become apparent. Many amateur spelunkers have met untimely ends in the clutches of this monstrous fungus's tentacles, since violet fungi are practically synonymous with caverns on Golarion. Anyone who has ever braved the world's caves for an extended period of time know the dangers of the deadly violet fungus. Darklands dwellers such as drow and duergars often bear the long, whip-like scars of at least one brush with this vicious plant's cruel, poison-infused tentacles. Canny subterranean trappers and scouts sometimes make use of cultivated violent fungi to catch game in the enormous caverns below the surface world. Some Darklands peoples also cultivate violet fungi as a means to defend their territory. Xulgaths in particular place violet fungi around the perimeters of their settlements as a first line of defense.",,3
Viper,"Each member of this family of venomous snakes has long, hinged fangs that inject potent venom in their prey. Different vipers inject different types of venom, which might result in paralysis, extreme pain and swelling, blood clotting, or even the sudden stopping of the victim’s heart.",Snake,-1
Viper Swarm,"The frightening mass of shining scales, gleaming eyes, and fangs dripping with venom that comprise a viper swarm has brought an end to many an unlucky adventurer. Normally nocturnal, these notoriously aggressive snakes strike at anything that comes within reach, be it limb or weapon. Their venom is a potent toxin that leaves victims shaky and weak.",Snake,4
Viper Vine,"A voracious, flesh-eating carnivore, the viper vine has a single enormous blossom arising from a thick, leafy tangle of snake-like vines. When the plant senses the approach of suitable prey through its sensitive, shallowly buried root system, it rises up like an agitated snake and unfurls its brightly colored bloom, an act that releases a cloud of mind-numbing pollen. Persistent stories claim the viper vine can lure prey into its clutches by swaying with a hypnotic motion, but this effect is in fact created by this invisible, odorless pollen cloud. Since a viper vine gains nourishment by consuming creatures rather than through ingesting moisture and soil, it has developed rudimentary locomotion and can drag itself along the ground with its tentacle-like roots. It even has a form of rudimentary sentience, allowing it to not only discern differences in prey and make limited tactical decisions, but also to avoid creatures that are particularly large or dangerous-looking. The area around viper vine hunting grounds is often strewn with the partially devoured remains of victims. It's not unusual to find the rotting corpses of wild animals, ill-fated adventurers, and even giants in the plant's immediate vicinity, along with a scattering of incidental treasure left behind on the corpses. A viper vine rarely returns to the carcass of a creature it killed earlier, preferring to hunt fresh meat.",,13
Virulak Necromancer,"Virulak necromancers are often intrigued by the interplay between poison and undeath, testing toxins on their dead flesh or, more commonly, on hapless living victims. This virulak necromancer was once a sorcerer but now considers their bloodline irrelevant.",Virulak,7
Virulak Villager,"A village of commoners raised to undeath by a mass poisoning might continue to go about the settled routines of life, posing an eerie scene for living creatures who enter their village. Virulak villagers prefer to attack with an advantage of numbers, but even a lone villager can pose a problem for unaware or inexperienced travelers.",Virulak,3
Vishkanya Infiltrator,"From a distance, vishkanyas share more than a passing resemblance to humans. However, a closer inspection reveals ophidian eyes with gold or white coloring, a forked tongue, and tiny, smooth scales set in serpentine patterns atop their skin. Even so, most onlookers assume these features to be an indicator of tiefling heritage or draconic magic, never suspecting how truly unusual the subject of their speculation is. Among outsiders, little is known of the vishkanya ancestry other than that a vishkanya carries a potent venom within their blood and saliva, knowledge which has led to widespread fear and distrust. To avoid persecution, vishkanyas entrench themselves deep into their chosen societies and train in the arts of subtlety. Drawn to work that allows them to put their skills to good use, vishkanyas often take the roles of spy, mercenary, bodyguard, and even assassin.",Vishkanya,3
Viskithrel,"One of the many horrid life-forms native to Zevgavizeb's Abyssal realm of Gluttondark, viskithrels—or “gluttonraptors”—are tireless hunters resembling tentacled theropods. They are social creatures by nature and prefer to hunt in large packs, chasing down prey and tearing them apart to share with their fellow hunters. A lone viskithrel forgoes hunting to frantically seek out others of its kind, starving to death if it cannot do so. Although viskithrels attack nearly any other creatures they encounter, they virtually never fight other viskithrels; even beasts in rival packs give each other space rather than fight over territory or prey. Other, smarter denizens of Gluttondark, such as xilvireks  herd and train viskithrels, working to convince the viskithrels that the trainer is one of their pack. This not only protects the trainer from attacks by the viskithrels, but also enables the trainer to easily direct them.",,15
Vitalia,"Foul occult magic, rare alchemical reagents, and copious amounts of spilled blood are the keys to creating a vitalia—also known as a heart horror— though thankfully the exact means of their creation has been long forgotten. Now, most vitalias now come into being by sheer accident. This unusual life-form cannot live without regular contact with blood, much like how fish cannot live long outside of water. Because of this, vitalias are rarely found outside the lairs of mad alchemists or wizards, living in pools of the life-giving substance. Physically, a vitalia somewhat resembles a blood-red giant jellyfish, though it also bears some semblance to a giant human heart.",,18
Void Zombie,"A void zombie arises when a humanoid dies from an akata's void death affliction. This walking corpse is animated by a larval akata attached to the deceased creature's brain, using a grotesque feeding tendril that emerges from the corpse's mouth to drink blood from its victims. A void zombie typically exists for only a few months before it collapses and the larval akata crawls free from the motionless shell. When it feels the natural end of its unlife approaching, a void zombie finds a secluded place to vomit forth the nearly mature akata larva, then withers away. The disgorged larva metamorphizes into a full-grown akata several hours later, usually eating the corpse as its first meal. The name “void zombie” is something of a misnomer; though still compelled by necromantic energies, a void zombie is a host in the life cycle of a parasitic alien, not a mindless, reanimated corpse (despite their similar appearances). The fact that a typical void zombie shares the neutral alignment of the larval akata within, rather than the intrinsically evil nature of other zombies, has caused some scholars to push to reclassify them under other names. Suggestions have included “void dead,” “akata spawn,” or “bloodwalker,” but the visceral and compelling commonplace name has proven difficult to shed. The driving force behind a void zombie's violence rises from the ravenous hunger of the alien parasite that serves as the channel for its animating negative energies. Necromancers have tried often to duplicate the void zombie, but without a larval akata hosted within, the result is simply a zombie with missing jaws or, at best, one that moves faster than normal. Others have compared a captive void zombie to a captive yellow musk thrall in an attempt to discover a potential link between the two— after all, both are animated bodies controlled by a parasitic outside force. Strangely, a void zombie becomes particularly violent when encountering a yellow musk thrall, making direct comparisons of the two creatures particularly difficult, or even dangerous. The fact that a void zombie, unlike a yellow musk thrall, is actually undead may hold some clues as to the source of this strange behavior.",,1
Voidglutton,"A voidglutton is a powerful type of will-o'-wisp that haunts a site where misery dwells—such as a graveyard, prison camp, or recent battlefield. A voidglutton appears as a seething sphere of glowing eyes swirling around an empty black vortex 4 feet wide. From within this vortex extend long, semi-transparent tendrils that end in seven-fingered, needled hands.",Wisp,8
Voidworm,"Other proteans don’t consider the flying, iridescent beings known as voidworms to be part of a protean caste at all, but instead merely a shameful side effect of the Maelstrom’s constantly churning energy. To call a voidworm a protean in the presence of a more powerful protean is as sure a way to instigate combat as any. Voidworms themselves have little interest in whether anyone sees them as proteans. They maintain a thriving ecology in the Maelstrom, frolicking in schools of up to 20 and playing in the chaos of constantly shifting realities. Elsewhere (such as on the Material Plane), voidworms are mesmerized by the principle of object permanence; many latch onto specific features of a region (such as a hillside or pond) and flit through the air around it for months or even years as they wait for the object of their curiosity to change. Minor changes— such as a tree’s change of color in the fall, a corpse’s slow decay, or periodic venting of steam from a geyser—all fascinate voidworms. A voidworm is about 2 feet long and weighs 2 pounds.",Protean,1
Vrock,"When the gates to the Abyss swing wide, the first demons through are often vrocks, vulture-headed scions of rage who wheel through the air on black wings or dance with the exultation of their fiendish power. Their hatred for mortals is matched only by their desire to inflict suffering through their horrible screech or their devastating dance. Vrocks form from the souls of hateful mortals who are thus given another chance to inflict their rage on the world. Vrocks often travel in small groups so as to make the best use of their dance of ruin ability, but they rarely appear in groups larger than four. Against small groups and individuals, they swoop down without fear, hoping to play with their prey before going for the kill. Against formidable foes, they are just as happy to fly above, using their dance of ruin to cast a storm of lightning down on them.",Demon,9
Vrolikai,"Unlike other demons, the dread vrolikai doesn't form from a sinful soul—they instead manifest from a nabasu once the nabasu finally satisfies their hunger and returns to the Abyss, and as such vrolikais suffer from no vulnerability associated with a specific sin. A vrolikai who survives this process and the period of vulnerability that follows gains great power and in time can claim large regions of the Abyss as their own domain. Also known as death demons, these murderous monsters often serve demon lords as executioners or assassins.",Demon,19

Vulpinal,"Vulpinals serve as the cunning and clever musicians and minstrels of the agathions. Incredibly far-ranging, these fox-like humanoids love traveling to learn and teach about all the unique songs, dances, myths, and traditions they can find. Though they prefer to travel alone, vulpinals are extremely gregarious toward those they meet on their journeys. They enjoy participating in the festivities of cultures they encounter, and they're known to form small traveling groups of like-minded individuals if they believe that their shared expertise can prove beneficial.",Agathion,6
Waldgeist,"Waldgeists act as avatars of nature that seek vengeance for environmental abuse, such as pollution and deforestation. These undead spirits of destroyed trees form at the site of their destruction or in a nearby woodland, if the original location was entirely razed. They become guardians of the forest, possessing power over the plants within its boundaries. Waldgeists show no mercy to anyone caught damaging their bonded woodland, attacking loggers, fey, travelers, and invasive species with equal prejudice.",Verdorite,8

Warden,"Wardens are the chief guardians of borders and frontiers. Whether they stand watch over a single village or an entire region, wardens keep a vigilant eye out for outside threats to their charges. Wardens are stalwart folk, often called to duty by Erastil to protect those around them. Be it times of war or upon the frontier, wardens are often the balanced edge of a blade between a community and the wilds at its fringes.",Magistrates,6
Warg,"Wargs hunt in packs and surround their prey like common wolves, but their cunning and penchant for taunting victims makes them easy to distinguish from their less-intelligent cousins. But despite their intelligence, wargs have simple desires for food and shelter, making them easy for evil humanoids such as orcs and hobgoblins to recruit to protect their camps or join them in battle. Most wargs are amenable to this arrangement, but if food should run out, wargs are more than willing to integrate goblinoid flesh into their diet.",Warg,2
Warsworn,"A warsworn is an animate mass of corpses composed of dozens, sometimes even hundreds, of victims of battle. They are formed by deities of undeath or war or, rarely, spontaneously manifest from the devastation of an especially horrendous battle.",,16
Wasp Swarm,"Wasp nests are made of chewed wood fibers foraged from the surrounding flora, which the wasps make into a material similar to paper. A single wasp nest can house thousands of individuals that emerge as a massive swarm. Most swarms attack only to protect their nest or if otherwise agitated, though druids and other primal enchanters can bend these venomous vermin to their will—to deadly effect.",Wasp,4
Watch Officer,"Watch officers are assigned to a certain area within a city or community. Often leading a small team of lower-ranking guards, they patrol those areas to maintain order and enforce laws. Watch officers get the job done, though their methods are not always gentle or kind. Because the watch officer is responsible to their superiors for their area, they sometimes need to make tough decisions between justice and effectiveness.",Officers,3
Water Mephit,"Water mephits are consummate jokers who are always happy to trade a favor for a good laugh. Just as fire mephits are the ones who cleave closest to evil without fully crossing over into true villainy, water mephits are the friendliest of the mephits and therefore the closest to good. Still, one should take care in making assumptions about a water mephit’s benevolence, for no one can reliably count on them to keep their inborn need for pranks and trickery at bay for long. Water mephits have blue-green skin that shimmers in light like   sh scales. Though water mephits’ wings look more like webbed fins than limbs capable of flight, they can flap their wings to fly through the air as easily as any other mephit. Water mephits prefer to swim, when possible, and they leave the water only when they must.","Elemental, Mephit",1
Water Orm,"Legendary creatures lurking in remote lakes, water orms always find their way into the tavern tales of lakeside communities. To some travelers, every lake of respectable size seems to be surrounded by towns full of fishers claiming to have spotted a water orm. These elusive creatures inhabit lakes mainly in cool and gloomy regions. Some claim that water orms are an offshoot of sea serpents and linnorms, but no credible link between these creatures has been found. Water orms have many features that sea serpents do not, such as the ability to understand the rudiments of language. Their natural inclination to avoid contact and remain hidden often remains at odds with their equally compelling curiosity about those they might spy upon the shores of their lakes. Water orm sightings usually occur when they can't help but to rise up to the surface to take a peek at someone (or something) particularly unusual on the beach or floating on the water's surface. These creatures are extremely long-lived and can go for decades, or even centuries, with very little to eat. This allows water orms to subsist in lakes without surfacing for many years, even in bodies of fresh water without ample food sources. Water orms might lie in a silty lake bed for years, their elusiveness only contributing to their mythical reputation. When a pet or child goes missing near a lake, rumors might hold that the local water orm is responsible, leading to folk tales that caution residents against venturing out alone near the water. While most water orms are described as serpentine or long-necked reptiles, others look similar to bizarrely elongated seals or whales, impossibly large sea horses, or long-necked creatures with paddles resembling those of elasmosauruses.",,10

Water Yai,"Among the most powerful yai are those who emulate the form of storm giants. Rather than lord over their giant-kin like most oni, though, water yai prefer to lurk alone in the world's oceans (or, much more rarely, large and remote freshwater lakes). When a water yai must interact with mortals beneath the waves, they prefer to do so while disguised as a storm giant. Water yai pursue the acquisition of material wealth and riches above all other interests, garbing themselves in richly colored, magically waterproofed kimonos and adorning their monstrous faces with all manner of jewelry. These yai can infuse their kimonos with eerie magical properties, and in combat, they can also fire bolts of electricity from their third eye.",Oni,17
Wayang Whisperblade,"In hushed tones, superstitious people tell their children stories of wayangs— living shadows who come out at night to eat misbehaving children.

Weasel,"Despite their small stature, weasels are skilled hunters. Nearly fearless in pursuit of food, they frequently kill creatures up to five times their own size. Their preferred tactic is to latch onto the back of their victim's neck and constrict with their jaws until the target dies. To keep themselves well fed, weasels kill more creatures than they need and stuff their victims into hollow logs or empty dens to eat later. Scholars have observed weasels, both in the wild and captivity, perform a bizarre behavior in front of their prey. They rush about unpredictably, throw themselves to the ground, wriggle into and out of burrows, and generally appear to behave entirely irrationally. In response, their prey becomes confused or seemingly hypnotized, which gives the weasel an opportunity to dash forward and strike a killing blow. A typical weasel is 12 inches long and weighs less than a pound.",Weasel,-1
Web Lurker,"Web lurkers, known also as ettercaps, are ugly monsters that not only dwell within the lairs of spiders and swarms, but actively cultivate and shepherd such vermin.",,3
Wemmuth,"Fertilized by large quantities of spilled blood, such as that found on bloodstained battlefields or in the war-torn regions surrounding besieged cities, wemmuths are vile swaths of vines that draw sustenance from mortal suffering, lapping up blood like water. Possessing a rudimentary intelligence and an unquenchable thirst for blood, wemmuths lie in wait for most of their lives, growing to incredible size in the bloody soil of their grisly homes. Though the vines that comprise a wemmuth’s body are scarcely thicker than rope, a single adult wemmuth system consists of 6 tons of vines, enough to stretch for 6,000 feet if stretched from end to end in a single straight line. Wemmuths never orient themselves this way, however, instead preferring to wrap themselves into massive mounds approximately 15 feet across and equally thick. Although wemmuths are often spotted lazing about, the scent of blood is enough to whip one into a violent frenzy. The creature condenses its entire mass into a sphere of sharp thorns and lashing vines, resembling a hateful tumbleweed the size of an elephant. Wemmuths commonly dig up massive boulders or entire trees from the ground and incorporate them into their rolling mass, using these objects to bolster their defense against many forms of attack or hurling them at faraway foes with terrifying precision. Some speculate that wemmuths are a form of diabolical corruption let loose upon Golarion by House Thrune of Cheliax, perhaps as a scorched earth tactic against their rivals. Influential nobles from Nirmathas and Molthune both point fingers at one another for the wemmuth’s creation, Nirmathas citing Molthune’s close ties to Infernal Cheliax and Molthune blaming the primal magic commonly employed by Nirmathas’s many druids and rangers. Several Varisian tales describe creatures closely matching the wemmuth’s description attempting to apprehend a famous folk trickster, while crusaders from Mendev adhere to the belief that the wemmuths were a blight unleashed upon Golarion by Deskari, former demon lord of locusts, before his defeat at the hands of mortal heroes.",,15

Werebat,"Werebats form organized colonies of opportunistic hunters. They aren't shy about transforming creatures to add to their colony, whom they initiate with elaborate social ceremonies and bloody hazing. The curse of the werebat gives them a strong urge to prey upon on weaker, lonely creatures. True werebats are often unusually tall and thin, with angular features. In combat, werebats favor their unarmed attacks because they can't fly while wielding weapons in their wings.",Werecreature,2
Werebear,"Unlike many other types of werecreature, a werebear does not become malevolent during its involuntary transformations, but is instead filled with righteous conviction. This indignation can still manifest in violent ways, though, as a transformed werebear becomes temporarily blind to its alliances and has little control over its bestial temper. As a result, werebears are loners, rarely even living together as families longer than necessary. Werebears know that as long as they live solitary lives, they can serve as protectors and guardians in wilderness regions without the overwhelming fear that, when the moon is full and the curse takes hold, they will rage against an innocent bystander or loved one. As long as there is nothing around to threaten it or the natural area it protects (typically a forest), a werebear in its animal form is generally content to forage and sleep away the night.",Werecreature,4
Wereboar,"Wereboars tend to be aggressive and stubborn, and often live with their own kind in small, remote communities. Even when they're inclined to interact with others, wereboars' short tempers and hostile nature lead other creatures to avoid them. Lone wereboars who settle down—often on remote farms—are extremely territorial, though others are content to roam and explore lands far from home. Their other habits also vary widely from individual to individual, right down to diet: some wereboars might feast on human flesh, while others are mostly vegetarian.",Werecreature,2
Werecrocodile,"The curse of the werecrocodile instills powerful hunger, urges violent displays of dominance, and amplifies greed.",Werecreature,2
Wererat,"Wererats tend to be selfishly opportunistic, avaricious, and paranoid as a result of their curse. Because wererats typically dwell in metropolitan areas where they can hide in plain sight, practically any city-goer could be a wererat in disguise—from the quiet shopkeep to the city’s criminal mastermind. The bustle of crowds and countless rat-holes make ghettos and shantytowns favored homes for wererats, especially since in these poorer districts the wererat can kill out of greed or fear with little chance of the authorities noticing. In some cities, wererats operate entire thieves’ guilds or organized crime rings, and membership requires willfully submitting to the wererat’s cursed bite. Wererats look very similar to ratfolk when in hybrid form, apart from potential differences in size, but ratfolk have no love for these monsters.",Werecreature,2
Weretiger,"These ferocious werecreatures stalk prey with the cunning and skill of a true apex predator. Weretigers typically view all life as a potential meal. Powerful nocturnal hunters with excellent senses that help them ambush prey, weretigers are adaptable to an extreme range of environments. However, weretigers living in densely populated cities (potentially as courtesans, assassins, or guild leaders) often struggle to suppress their killer instincts, becoming overwhelmed by the urge to hunt. They prefer to wear loose-fitting clothing and rely on their claws and jaws in a fight.",Werecreature,4
Werewolf,"The curse of the werewolf—known as lycanthropy to many—instills in its carriers the hungry bloodlust and predatory instincts of the wolf. Werewolves tend to dwell on the fringes of society or in small settlements where, in their humanoid forms, they work as laborers, hunters, farmers, or trappers. At night, however, these same villagers transform into violent killers and sadistic stalkers who prey on their neighbors. Werewolves are the quintessential werecreature, and the first that comes to mind when most people speak of such beings. Although most werewolves hide their curse by adopting solitary lifestyles, some retain the pack mentality of true wolves. A small group of such werewolves typically forms a family-like pack, with the eldest or most powerful serving as the leader; new pack mates are hand-chosen and inculcated into the family as its influence grows.",Werecreature,3
Weykoward,"Beneath the camps of Hillcross, Mammoth Lord followings store belongings both precious and mundane in unsecured vaults called weykos. As power changes hands among Mammoth Lords and followings go extinct or become forgotten, such weykos are often abandoned for so long that they become indistinguishable from trash heaps or middens. Furthermore, if the conditions are just so, such weykos can spring to life as a result of latent primal magic or ancestral memories locked within the forgotten weyko that refuse to be forgotten.",,10
Wheel Archon,"Among the most terrifying archons to behold, and easily the most difficult for mortals to comprehend, is the wheel archon, so named for its appearance as a flying, armor-plated wheel of fire with eyes on each spoke. Wheel archons often serve as messengers or harbingers for the armies of heaven, as their stubborn, indomitable natures make them ill-suited for missions requiring diplomacy or tact. Indeed, they have a legendary intolerance and single-mindedness in the pursuit of the punishment of evil. Wheel archons can't tolerate deceit and easily see through lies. The sensation of this celestial being's divine eyes all fixing upon a single target is usually enough to encourage honesty, but when a wheel archon detects a falsehood, their righteous wrath takes over and they mete out punishment to sinners without quarter.",Archon,16
Whimwyrm,"Whimwyrms are unpredictable dragons native to the whimsically dangerous First World. While their coloration and appearance might evoke reactions of adoration, their moods shift quickly from one extreme to the other. Many who have assumed that their adorability and relatively small size equates to safety have met swift and grisly ends on a whimwyrm's fangs or magic. A whimwyrm is a slender, sleek dragon, not much longer than seven feet from snout to tail, but its speed in combat is unnerving. When a whimwyrm attacks, be it with its fanged mouth or its long tail, it makes several quick, darting snaps or lashes at once. While stylistically, these attacks consist of multiple bites or lashings, they still resolve as a single Strike.",,17
Whipping Willow,"These tall, thin figures are too treelike to be dryads, yet too humanoid to be arboreals. Their blank faces and thin trunks bear only the slightest suggestion of humanoid features. Rather than hands, their long, branchlike arms eventually split into equally proportioned branchlike digits, which the willows use both to fight and swing through their native plane.","Elemental, Wood",4
Wight,"Wights are undead humanoids that, much like wraiths, can drain the life from living creatures with but a touch. They arise as a result of necromantic rituals, especially violent deaths, or the sheer malevolent will of the deceased. As many types of wights exist as types of people from which they might be created. Hulking brutes, skittering sneaks, and cunning tinkers all make for different wights with different niches to fill. Environment, too, plays a part in determining a wight’s special abilities and defenses. Frost wights, for instances, can be found in the parts of the world where exposure is a common end. Regardless, wights typically haunt burial grounds, catacombs, or other places of the dead. But their hunger is targeted toward the living—those individuals who remind them of the shackles of mortality and whom they feel compelled to “free” to the state of undeath. A single wight can wreak a lot of havoc if it is compelled to rise from its tomb. Because creatures slain by wights become wights as well, all it takes is a single wight and a handful of unlucky graveyard visitors to create a veritable horde of these undead. Thus, canny priests and adventurers know that the best solution to a wight problem is swift and total eradication. Care must be taken, though, to destroy wight spawn before attempting to destroy the parent wight, for spawn without a master gain the ability to create spawn of their own. Durable and sustained as they are by negative energy, wights can last in harsh environments without decaying the way some lesser undead do. They might dwell in high mountain passes, sealed passageways, or submerged in bogs or lakes for decades or even centuries before the passage of an unsuspecting traveler rouses them from their rest.",Wight,3

Wild Hunt Archer,"These lithe, androgynous humanoids have pointed ears, glowing green eyes, and hair that flows softly at all times as if in a gentle breeze. They are methodical hunters who fire their bows with uncanny accuracy. Since wild hunt archers tend to be slower on foot than most of their companions, they often rely on wild hunt horses to provide increased mobility. Rather than carrying normal arrows, they can produce arrows as needed from magical quivers—these quivers do not function in this manner for anyone other than wild hunt archers.",Wild Hunt,16
Wild Hunt Horse,"These steeds stand upon puffs of air, their grassy manes and tails swishing majestically in the wind. When they are not participating in a hunt, wild hunt horses enjoy constructing complicated courses through land and sky and racing each other for ever-changing stakes.",Wild Hunt,15
Wild Hunt Hound,"Wild hunt hounds are intelligent hunters and expert trackers that take the lead against elusive prey. Left to their own devices, they seek out creatures that are notoriously difficult to track. They are always surrounded with green mist composed of fragments of the spirits of the wild hunt's victims, a mystic fog that forms itself into a spectral pack to fight at its side.",Wild Hunt,14
Wild Hunt Monarch,"Each wild hunt follows a wild hunt monarch, who travels between the realm of the fey and the Material Plane in search of new quarry. These limber and regal humanoids have elk antlers, long pointed ears, flowing white hair, and luminescent green eyes.",Wild Hunt,20
Wild Hunt Scout,"These compact few have pointed ears, green eyes, and ram's horns. They relish the chance to seek revenge upon those who have wronged or insulted the wild hunt, but they tend to grow bored when the stakes aren't lethal.",Wild Hunt,18
Will-o’-Wisp,"Malevolent balls of colored light, will-o’-wisps haunt lonely marshes and forests where they lure unsuspecting travelers into danger. Will-o’-wisps can vary the color and illumination they shed, and delight in mimicking bobbing lanterns or distant fires to draw lost or disoriented travelers off of safe trails. They can extinguish their illumination entirely to become invisible, and they enjoy doing so once their victims are wholly lost and have realized that the bobbing light in the distance isn’t, in fact, leading them to safety. Even invisible, however, a will-o’-wisp rarely ventures far from its target, as it feasts upon the panic and dread felt by its victims. Beneath its glow, a will-o’-wisp’s body is a spongy ball approximately 1 foot in diameter and weighing less than 5 pounds. Although most will-o’-wisps are merely translucent, featureless orbs, gaining definition only in the shifting illumination they create, a few have dark mottling that makes them resemble a skull when viewed closely. Will-o’-wisps have no need for mundane nourishment, and in fact lack the ability to consume matter of any kind; they find all the sustenance they need in the terror of nearby creatures. For this reason, they like to work alongside undead that produce terror in their victims. Will-o’-wisps are long-lived, if not effectively immortal, and they have good memories. A cowed or defeated will-o’-wisp can be a good source of lore and information, though acquiring such cooperation from such a sinister monster is no easy feat. Will-o’-wisps inhabit desolate swamps and forests and are generally active at twilight and after dark. They are therefore reluctant to lead victims into immediately fatal areas such as deadfalls, but instead prefer hazards where their victims suffer over a long time, such as pockets of stale or poisonous air, patches of quicksand, and dens of bigger monsters. According to will-o’-wisps, different types of fear have subtle differences in flavor. The lurking dread in the pit of the stomach that gnaws at those who slowly become aware of the fact that they’re lost produces a much different taste than the sudden stark terror of imminent death in the face of a towering monster. Because of this, will-o’-wisps try to vary the ways in which they induce terror in their prey, to ensure they don’t tire of certain flavors of fear.",Wisp,6
Winter Hag,"On long, dark winter nights, folk at the edges of civilization have learned to be wary of old women who come knocking at their door. They look for her tracks in the snow and other telltale signs to make sure she isn't a winter hag who plans to drag them off and feast on their bones. In truth, winter hags are more subtle monsters, entrapping humanoids in schemes that create mistrust and anger within a village before picking off the residents one or two at a time, heightening the fear and anger of those who remain. When her work is done, a winter hag revels in the silence of a frost-rimed village in which no hearth fires are left burning.",Hag,7
Winter Wolf,"Winter wolves are related to wargs, but are larger, smarter, and far more dangerous. They are capable of exhaling plumes of freezing breath and are big enough to easily serve as mounts for orcs and hobgoblins—provided the winter wolf is willing, of course. Like wargs, winter wolves hunt in packs, but unlike their smaller cousins, they have a notable proud streak. When they deign to serve others, they reserve this privilege for larger and more dangerous creatures such as frost giants, renegade yetis, or even white dragons.",Warg,5
Witchfire,"Manifesting as a sinuous form wreathed in sickly green flames, this incorporeal undead forms when a powerful hag or witch dies in agony or rage. The body at the center of the flames usually resembles the witch's idealized self-image, regardless of their age and appearance at the time of their death. A witchfire often resides in a bog or swamp, which slowly blackens and decays around them. These regions are often plagued by will-o'-wisps, which seem to have an uncanny relationship with the resident witchfire. A witchfire might visit villages on the edge of their home terrain to lure away villagers, but always attack victims within earshot to make sure that other villagers hear the screams. A witchfire might also ally with other hags or witches and even join their covens, but a witchfire is incapable of forming covens entirely on their own.",,9
Witchwyrd,"Witchwyrds conceal most of their faces, leaving only their eyes unmasked. Their inscrutability is a boon to one of their most significant interests—mercantilism— and many haughty witchwyrds openly revel in the befuddlement inspired by their mysterious guises and mannerisms. Witchwyrds have a keen eye for new opportunities and markets, and a witchwyrd almost always knows when someone is trying to pull one over on them. These four-armed humanoid creatures have hairless blue-gray skin, are typically 6-1/2 feet tall, and weigh 300 pounds. Their hands have three evenly sized and spaced digits in a tripod-like arrangement. When not trying to blend in with the local community, witchwyrds favor outlandish, loose-fitting clothes in bright reds or yellows and a signature conical hat. They tend to prefer the driest, warmest regions of the lands they visit—perhaps an indicator of their mysterious home world. This, however, is the only indicator; witchwyrds are notoriously close-mouthed about details of this distant world, and with good reason: most witchwyrds on Golarion have never visited their ancestral home. To these witchwyrds, the notion of a home planet is a constant thorn in their side, and when asked, many choose to ignore the question altogether. Others are so agitated by these queries that they respond with impatience or even violence. Some scholars have theorized a connection between witchwyrds and several other four-armed creatures, but like with questions of their place of origin, witchwyrds have little to say about the topic.",,6
Withered,"If a husk zombie survives for several years, their body continues to dry out, their flesh hardens, and their eyes turn into pale, glowing orbs set deep into otherwise empty sockets. Known as the withered, these zombies are cunning, capable of forming complex plans and even setting traps utilizing their less-intelligent brethren to lure the unsuspecting into deadly ambushes.",Zombie,5
Wizard Sponge,"This strange type of fungus colony takes its name from its initial purpose: the wizard who first developed it sought a means to keep her tower clean from residue both mundane and magical. Wizard sponge does just that, dutifully cleaning its vicinity by devouring dust, organic debris, and even the decaying bodies of fallen creatures. Its designer intentionally crafted the fungus to not merely resist but be healed by fire, intended as an additional safety feature, and most varieties have a convenient side effect of being edible once slain. Unfortunately, the fungus also developed an unexpected ability to magically mutate over time, which eventually led to its escape and independent propagation. Wizard sponge colonies of various sizes and shapes now thrive in dungeons, caverns, sewers, abandoned castles, crypts, and even the basements of some occupied dwellings. They often carry along bits of partially consumed material with them, such as clothing, limbs, and adventuring gear—sometimes even valuable treasures! An individual colony typically takes on distinctive properties based on what it's consumed in its environment; a variety living in a necromancer's crypt might acquire the undead's affinity for negative energy, for example. Variant Sponges Many types of wizard sponge exist, as an individual colony takes on distinctive properties based on what they've consumed in their environment. Crypt: The wizard sponge gains negative healing. Fey Domain: The wizard sponge gains weakness 5 to cold iron, increases its Speed and climb Speed to 30 feet, and develops a strangely capricious growth pattern despite being mindless, such as growing in the pockets of a creature's clothing before devouring it. Fiendish Temple: The sponge gains weakness 5 to good damage, and Swarming Slither deals an extra 1d6 evil damage. Toxic Lair: Swarming Slither deals 1d10 acid damage and 1d10 poison damage. If this variety is eaten, it deals 1d6 persistent poison damage. Underwater: The sponge grows as an aquatic fungus, gaining a swim speed of 20 feet.",,5
Wolf,"Wolves live and hunt in packs, which, contrary to popular belief, are not led by the strongest in the group, but typically consist of a mated pair, their pups, and juvenile offspring from previous mating seasons. Offspring generally leave their parents’ pack upon reaching maturity, at which point they seek out mates of their own to go form their own packs elsewhere. Humanoids are not traditionally viewed as prey animals by wolves, but extraordinary circumstances can lead these animals to attack people, especially in winter months and other situations where traditional prey (deer and elk, mainly) is scarce. Some beings, such as powerful vampires, can call upon wolves to aid them in combat.",Wolf,1
Wolf Skeleton,"Without the burden of flesh, skeletal wolves charge across the battlefield with terrifying speed.",Skeleton,0
Wolliped,"Wollipeds are large, docile herd animals found in the snowy foothills of large mountains. Their eight legs give them sure footing even in icy terrain, and they grow thick, warm fleece as protection against the elements. Arctic ranchers have been breeding wollipeds for hundreds of years, as the gentle creatures take well to domestication and make plentiful, hardy sources of meat, milk, and wool. The creatures also provide sure-footed transport in difficult mountain regions, and they can even be trained for plowing and hauling if necessary. As a result of their widespread domestication, few are found in the wild. Young wollipeds have weak vision during their first few weeks and habitually follow any larger creature that walks by. Usually, these young wollipeds become attached their rancher or parents, but on occasion a few might follow large wild creatures and wander off from their herd. This has led to feral wollipeds around the Kodar mountains in Irrisen that are much more aggressive than their domesticated cousins. Wollipeds are extremely sturdy, and their docile temperaments make them excellent mounts for those traveling mountain passes. Some mountain settlements have further trained their wollipeds to fight. Battle-ready wollipeds are formidable enemies that pose a threat to even the most experienced of challengers—But even untrained, wollipeds are not defenseless. In addition to their long tusks, they have developed spitting as a way of communication and assault, and readily regurgitate a mixture of stomach acid and the remnants of their last meal to deter predators. Few on Golarion realize that these arctic beasts are not native to their world. Wollipeds originated on the planet Triaxus, a world with a magically enhanced eccentric orbit around the same star as Golarion. During the centuries-long Triaxian winters, wollipeds play an integral role in many communities as food, wool, transportation, and even a simple form of companionship. During the equally extended tropical summers, wollipeds retreat to the polar extremes of their world to await the return of the long snows.",,3
Wolverine,"Wolverines resemble small bears, to which they are related. Stocky and muscular with long claws, wolverines are about 3 feet in length and weigh approximately 40 pounds. They have a thick fur coat that protects them from the cold temperatures of the forests and frozen tundras where they reside.",Wolverine,2
Wood Giant,"Wood giants are the denizens and protectors of the deepest, most primeval forests in the world. They dedicate their entire lives to the preservation of nature—a role that they believe nature itself has selected them to carry out. Wood giants are patient and kind to those who show respect and care for wild places. Although most wood giants consider civilization as simply another part of the world, they value places untouched by permanent structures and dense humanoid settlements. Wood giants have long, drooping ears and more slender builds than most giants. Despite their size, they are graceful and agile, able to move through dense forests and brush with little sound. They have been known to work closely with druids and others who share their respect for the sanctity of wilderness regions. Wood giants spend their days patrolling vast swaths of territory, foraging, and keeping an eye out for any who would despoil their lands. While they respect the connection to nature they share with many fey creatures and remain on good terms with them, wood giants see most fey as far too flighty to take part in any long-term plans. An average wood giant stands 14 feet tall and weighs 1,200 pounds.",Giant,6
Wood Golem,"Wood golems are often given vaguely humanoid shapes, almost as if cobbled together from scraps of firewood and discarded burls. It's less common for wood golems to have artistic embellishments such as engraved patterns, or to be carved in the shapes of different types of creatures to meet the tastes of their owners. While wealthy patrons have been known to commission wood golems to be painstakingly carved to resemble themselves or their ancestors, to serve dual purposes of protection and ego bolstering, most wood golem crafters don't bother. Druids and creatures who protect woodlands, such as arboreals, typically see wood golems as an affront or an abomination, akin to the horror humanoids often feel when facing a carrion or flesh golem. As a result, it is rare to see such creatures serving as guardians for fey or druidic holy sites, despite the thematic match between the wood golem's appearance and such locations.",Golem,6
Wood Scamp,"A wood scamp's veiny, bat-like wings mimic the lamina and venules of a leaf. This, along with their stout green torsos and limbs, enables them to easily blend into the branches of a living tree. They're unusually social for scamps and prefer to work in groups when possible. By their nature, they find their home plane rather boring, and many of them are abuzz with excitement as the plane reopens. They're eager to travel to new places where they can cause mischief.","Elemental, Mephit",1
Wood Wisp,"Like other wisps, wood wisps roam their plane and attune to other wisps, wandering with them in symphonies. Because of their willingness to bond, wood wisps appear outside their home plane more than other wood elementals, though they're still relatively rare compared to other wisps. Wood wisps resemble coconuts trailed by thick nests of branches that cover and conceal even deeper webs of thorny vines. They are, unfortunately, both unaware of the pain these thorns can cause fleshy creatures and very physically affectionate in their eagerness to offer assistance.","Elemental, Wisp",0
Woolly Rhinoceros,"Even bulkier than their non-woolly cousins, these rhinoceroses have a shaggy pelt of long, thick fur and a huge crescent-shaped horn. Woolly rhinos inhabit areas of arid tundra and cold steppes, spending much of their day grazing for sustenance.",Rhinoceros,6
Worm That Walks Cultist,This worm that walks was a cultist of the Great Old One Hastur in its prior life. It continues its conspiracies and strives to further its evil plots in its new life.,Worm That Walks,14
Wraith,"Wraiths are malevolent undead who drain life and shun light. Their shadowy, incorporeal forms are dotted with burning eyes that reffect their hatred for the living, and shadowy claws are weapon enough to steal the vitality from their enemies. A wraith may be created by foul necromancy, but more often they are the result of a hermitic murderer or mutilator who even in death could not give up their wicked ways. Further complicating the matter is the fact that wraiths multiply by consuming and transforming the living into more of their foul kind—meaning a handful of wraiths left unchecked can easily turn into a horde of darkness. Wraiths weigh nothing and are unharmed by most physical attacks. They haunt any place where they can feed on the living, though their vulnerability to sunlight confines them to the shadowy places of the world—places where they can blend in seamlessly with their dark surroundings before silently engulfing their prey. Wraiths may form packs with others of their kind in places where death and mayhem are commonplace—countrysides ravaged by war, metropolitan underworlds run by criminal overlords, or sites of fiendish cultic rituals. In these places, the living do well to tread with sunrods and powerful clerics in tow. Ruins, sewers, and abandoned buildings provide sanctuary for wraiths during the day, as the creatures hunt exclusively at night or in dark places. Wraiths are smart enough to take advantage of their incorporeality in combat, so they keep to tortuous caverns or structures with hallways and avoid open areas. As they’re formed purely of anti-life from the Negative Energy Plane, wraiths pervade that unholy realm. Within nations and civilizations ruled by the undead, wraiths have places of power as assassins and spies. They’re among the ruling class in Geb, but have greater numbers in Ustalav, where packs of wraiths roam graveyards and misty trails, consuming the populations of entire villages. In other parts of the world, wraiths tend not to wander and limit their activity to smaller environs, typically just the site of their chosen haunting and its immediate surroundings.",Wraith,6
Wrath Riot,"Wrath demons are among the most well-known and feared of the Abyss's fiends, but sometimes a wrath demon becomes stunted in size as the result of too many failed rampages, a punishment inflicted by an angry demonic commander or simple ill fortune. These smaller wrath demons, not much larger than humans, are typically slaughtered quickly by their larger kin, but rarely a group of undersized vrocks can gather in numbers large enough to form a wrath riot.",Demon Throng,16
Wyrmwraith,"Though they refused to accept death, wyrmwraiths nonetheless despise their new undead condition. Indeed, lacking in all motivation to collect treasure, a wyrmwraith instead fixates on their hatred of all living things (especially dragons) and their own self-loathing. A wyrmwraith blights the land with their very presence, spreading slowly until their lair becomes a lifeless wasteland haunted by other undead.",Wyrmwraith,17
Wyrwood Sneak,"Wyrwood sneaks specialize in moving unseen behind enemy lines, performing reconnaissance and quietly eliminating threats.",Wyrwood,1
Wyvern,"A wyvern is a venomous drake with a well-earned reputation for impatience and aggression. As much as 15 feet long and weighing up to 1,000 pounds, a wyvern’s resilient body allows it to crash talons-first into large prey without serious risk to itself. A wyvern uses its momentum to stun its target before injecting it with searing venom or carrying it over the side of a nearby cliff. Because a wyvern lacks the strength to haul its prey all the way to its nest intact, it is far more likely to lift and drop its victim over a gully or canyon and let gravity do its work before it descends to pick apart the carcass. Conversation is of little interest to a wyvern, as the creature typically speaks only to taunt its prey, issue territorial claims, or demand tribute. Even so, many wyverns enjoy grim humor and tales of violent acts, particularly if those acts were committed by the storyteller. A wyvern properly appeased with meat, entertainment, and treasure sometimes agrees to provide assistance ranging from giving directions to serving as a mount for a powerful humanoid. However, these arrangements rarely last more than a few weeks before the wyvern’s pride, malice, or insolence inspires it to flee or even betray its allies. Only the truly cruel can cow a wyvern into servitude for an extended period, as most wyverns are so self-interested that they go out of their way to avoid helping others.",Drake,6
Xill,"Xills visit the Material Plane, where they're often known as ethereal stalkers, primarily to maraud and to kidnap creatures back to their native Ethereal Plane. These four-armed, warmongering monsters paralyze their victims before implanting them with eggs using an ovipositor normally kept retracted behind their mandibles. Their single-minded drive to expand and conquer is so all-encompassing that while they work together dutifully and without dissent, there is little else in their lives.",,6
Xilvirek,Xilvireks are the result of the strange evolution that takes place in Zevgavizeb’s Abyssal realm. These fiends resemble their dread demon lord and claim to be living embodiments of the Lord of Reptiles’s snapping jaws.,,12
Ximtal,"The struggles of loneliness and the anxiety that accompanies that feeling plague many creatures, and ximtals delight in exploiting this fear for their own perverse gain. Appearing as hybrids of rats and crabs with grasping tentacles, these scheming fiends manipulate their victims over long spans of time, like pakalchis, to savor the most fear they can. Ximtals use subtlety to entrap their prey and often don't directly engage their targets. They use insecurities as a tool and force poor behavior in mortals they set their sights on. They prefer to focus their machinations on strong-willed and well-intentioned mortals, hoping to erode their pride and self-worth and ultimately lead them eschew altruistic efforts. Rather than focusing on a single victim, a ximtal might instead seek out a particular cause of interest to the sahkil's appetites. These creatures often wander the multiverse seeking to sabotage societal crusades or suppress divergent ideologies. While most ximtals work alone, they sometimes enlist the assistance of pakalchis, who share similar tastes in mortal fear. Together and focused, these two types of fiends can dissolve individual self-worth, relationships, and even entire organizations.",Sahkil,17

Xotanispawn,"Xotanispawn are monstrous versions of scavenging beetle larvae that have been corrupted and mutated by feeding on the remains of Xotani the Firebleeder, a slain Spawn of Rovagug buried beneath Pale Mountain in Katapesh. These creatures look vaguely like the minute insects they once were, with a sclerotized head and chitinous body plates, six legs, and numerous dorsal spines lining the joints and edges of each segment. However, by feeding on the unholy remains of Xotani, the spawn have manifested many of the traits of the infamous Firebleeder, most notably a blisteringly hot internal temperature and powerful fire attacks—to say nothing of their monstrous size. Internal heat radiates from every surface of a Xotanispawn, even from its mouth. Any contact with a Xotanispawn results in burns and the risk of catching on fire. Thankfully, Xotanispawn have also inherited Xotani’s weaknesses to cold and sunlight. They are rarely encountered on the surface during the day, opting to emerge from their subterranean lairs only at night.
",,17
Xulgath Bilebearer,"While many xulgaths impose their will by strength or sheer numbers, some resort to more nefarious—and grotesque—means to take care of matters. The bilebearer takes its name from its eponymous bile, a putrid substance that oozes from gill-like folds in its colorful, bulging neck. Bilebearers coat their weapons with the viscous substance or secrete a concentrated dose that suffuses the air around them and disables foes. A bilebearer’s neck bulges with folds of scaled flesh that extend almost to the creature’s shoulders, containing its namesake bile productions glands inside. These folds expand and contract with each breath, and each fold has a vertical line of muscled pores that gradually exudes the thick substance, providing a perpetual supply for coating weapons. Bilebearers’ necks also contain inflatable bladders, which they can quickly pressurize to expel a blast of vaporized bile in a noxious, overwhelming cloud. Bilebearers serve their clutches by kidnapping or slaying specific enemies. They frequently accompany their kin, particularly xulgath skulkers, to raid rival clutches or intercept foes. A bilebearer’s mode of attack typically involves sneaking in, overwhelming any guards with a noxious blast of bile, and then turning their attention to the primary target. The xulgath either shreds the rapidly weakening victim on the spot or drags them away for future violence.
",Xulgath,2
Xulgath Deepmouth,"Xulgath deepmouths wield the powers of the Abyss against their clutch's enemies and invoke righteous fear in their followers. The vast majority of deepmouths worship demon lords, most commonly Zevgavizeb. Scalescribing—the warping of xulgath flesh into imitations of Abyssal script—is a widespread practice among deepmouths, enabling them to channel the power of the Abyss through their fanatical devotees' own bodies.",Xulgath,12
Xulgath Gutrager,"Xulgath gutragers exhibit more extreme developments along the same physiological path as their bilebearer cousins. They are stockier and faster, with necks and limbs corded with muscle. They are also denser, with multiple stomachs full of fluids even more caustic than those of the bilebearer. Like the bilebearer, gutragers lack the distinctive stench typical of most xulgaths. A gutrager’s torso conceals its most disturbing feature—a densely coiled esophagus. Pressurized bladders and a muscular throat allow the gutrager to propel its esophagus outward in an explosion of yellow flesh and acidic bile; caustic stomach acid coating the esophagus makes even brief physical contact with the organ dangerous. As a last resort, the gutrager can intentionally accelerate the corrosion in its esophagus, releasing vile acid in a burst that also ends its life.",Xulgath,10
Xulgath Leader,"Xulgath leaders are usually the strongest, most violent members of a community—although in some cases, particularly in larger groups, xulgath tribes are led by powerful demon cultists or other monsters who seek to use the xulgaths as servants or slaves.",Xulgath,3
Xulgath Ravening,"Strength and hunger drive most xulgath societies, reinforced by the tenets of their abyssal patron Zevgavizeb. A powerful leader can seize control of a xulgath community and direct their followers to fight as a unit, but formation fighting isn't something most xulgaths practice. This mob mentality often results in overzealous warriors tripping over or even biting each other. Suitably, these mobs have earned the name “ravenings,” a term also used when describing Zevgavizeb's carnivorous rampages and referring to the millennia of xulgath infighting and social decline.",,4
Xulgath Skulker,"Xulgath warrens are patrolled—some might say “haunted”—by the community’s skulkers. These xulgaths specialize in stealth, striking swiftly from the shadows and otherwise ambushing foes.",Xulgath,2
Xulgath Spinesnapper,"Xulgath physiological diversity doesn’t always imply drastic change; some xulgaths are simply much larger and stronger than their clutchmates. Most xulgaths call such siblings spinesnappers, though terms like bonebreaker, marrowvent, or similarly violent epithets are equally common. A typical spinesnapper is 9 feet tall and weighs 350 pounds. In battle, spinesnappers have all the speed, grace, and strength of a sledgehammer. They are ideal shock troops and make a good first line of defense. When an inter-clutch conflict leads to a duel, spinesnappers are typically called upon to rise to the challenge. In this case, a spinesnapper representative from each clutch squares off for what is in theory a nonlethal wrestling match, after which the winner scrapes off some of the loser’s scales as a trophy.",Xulgath,5
Xulgath Stoneliege,"Stonelieges are xulgaths magically infused with living earth—the very bones of the world. They are created through a process xulgaths call stone-binding, which can be performed with complex alchemy, powerful psychic magic, or Abyssal rituals. Their scales are like stone slabs, and their bones are as dense as bedrock, so they are among the hardiest and longest-lived xulgaths. To stonelieges, earth is as mutable as water, and their innate power to shape the soil and stone beneath their feet makes them integral members of xulgath society (as well as formidable combatants).",Xulgath,8
Xulgath Thoughtmaw,Xulgath thoughtmaws are inheritors of the xulgaths' ancient psychic legacy. They eagerly and liberally use their ability to extract knowledge from their foes to quicken their own prodigious intellects.,Xulgath,15
Xulgath Warrior,"Xulgath warriors strike with fury and eager cruelty, always ready for the next fight. The taking of prizes from battle—including weapons and items stolen from defeated foes along with grislier trophies harvested from fallen victims’ flesh—is a popular pursuit among these vicious reptiles, and those whose armor and scales are most adorned are awarded the greatest respect (and perhaps fear) from their kin.",Xulgath,1
Yaganty,"Yaganties are lean, hairy humanoids with lanky torsos, horned heads, and bulbous black eyes. The elongated fingers of one their hands are made of candlestick wax, and their fingertips, which have wicks instead of nails, burn endlessly. In the dead of night, the flickering light of a yaganty’s fingertips casts dramatic shadows across their face and highlights their trollish visage. Yaganty fables follow a common formula. A wayward pedestrian, traveling at night and usually in a forest, follows distant lights with the hope that the lights belong to a fellow wayfarer, only to come face-to-face with a gangly monster. The story ends in one of three ways: the traveler appeals to the yaganty with a gift of gold (the exact sum necessary varies wildly by the telling), the yaganty slays the traveler over some incomprehensible transgression, or, even more inexplicably, the yaganty offers the lost traveler five candles in simple charity so that the light might guide them home.",,10
Yaiafineti,"Yaiafinetis grow only during periods of extended twilight, thriving across the cold tundra of the Crown of the World exclusively in the winter months. To survive in such harsh conditions, the yaiafineti, or dusk poppy, sprouts independent polyps that detach and then creep across the tundra in search of food for their matriarch. Dusk poppies sprout from spores that attach to carcasses, but they only blossom during the long twilight unique to the Crown of the World. The perfect conditions for their development are so rare that yaiafineti have developed a vigorous appetite. They feed unceasingly. Much of their energy goes to developing more polyps, and one plant can easily spawn a small infestation of these deadly bulbs. The plants send out runner shoots that quickly develop purple bulbs. These bulbs, the plant's polyps, sprout many long, hooked vines before detaching from the mother plant. Polyps are short lived but active, foraging for a week or so before they shrivel and die. These polyps aren't dangerous unless handled. They secrete a fine dust that acts as a paralyzing poison that seizes the nervous system of creatures who come in contact with them. Paralyzing Poison (poison) Saving Throw DC 19 Fortitude; Maximum Duration 6 rounds; Stage 1 flat-footed and clumsy 1 (1 round); Stage 2 flat-footed and clumsy 2 (1 round); Stage 3 paralyzed (1 round)",,8
Yamaraj,"The greatest judges among the psychopomps are the massive yamarajes, whose wisdom is legendary and whose edicts are unappealable except to ushers or Pharasma herself. A yamaraj resembles an immense dragon with dark, feathery scales and an emotionless, dispassionate gaze behind a feathered mask. When not serving as the senior magistrates, lords, and generals of the Boneyard, yamarajes pursue highly individualistic hobbies, such as gardening or literature. They are willing to halt in their duties to converse with mortals whose expertise matches their interests.",Psychopomp,20

Yellow Musk Brute,"A creature transformed by a yellow musk creeper's tendrils boring into its brain becomes a yellow musk thrall if it's Small or Medium, or a yellow musk brute if Large (a Small creature becomes a Small thrall rather than a Medium one). The transformation takes 1 hour. A yellow musk thrall takes only the most rudimentary of actions: bringing the yellow musk creeper water and new creatures to infest. After a few days (or if the creeper dies), the thrall wanders off into the wilderness and falls dead within 24 hours. The body of a deceased thrall sprouts a new yellow musk creeper within hours of its death, becoming a fully grown plant within 24 hours.",Yellow Musk Creeper,2
Yellow Musk Creeper,"Made up of thick, green vines with numerous yellow flowers, the yellow musk creeper grows at places where the ground is enriched with spilled blood and corpses, like battlefields and graveyards. An ideal environment for the yellow musk creeper isn't inhabited, but draws occasional humanoid visitors the plant can transform into thralls. The yellow musk creeper enraptures creatures with its bright yellow pollen to bring them close. It then physically alters their brains with its tendrils, implanting a seed in each to turn the creatures into mindless thralls. The yellow musk creeper might try to take over a sleeping creature, but it lacks the faculties to sneak up on anyone, and is likely to wake victims before it can drag itself close enough. The plant's pollen can spread far on the wind but quickly becomes too diffuse to cause harm. Wilderness scouts learn to sniff out the distinctive musky scent of the pollen, which stays potent even in harmless quantities. A sprouting creeper is also easy to detect, since it grows from the rotting, messy corpse of a thrall creature.",Yellow Musk Creeper,2
Yellow Musk Thrall,"A creature transformed by a yellow musk creeper's tendrils boring into its brain becomes a yellow musk thrall if it's Small or Medium, or a yellow musk brute if Large (a Small creature becomes a Small thrall rather than a Medium one). The transformation takes 1 hour. A yellow musk thrall takes only the most rudimentary of actions: bringing the yellow musk creeper water and new creatures to infest. After a few days (or if the creeper dies), the thrall wanders off into the wilderness and falls dead within 24 hours. The body of a deceased thrall sprouts a new yellow musk creeper within hours of its death, becoming a fully grown plant within 24 hours.",Yellow Musk Creeper,-1
Yeth Hound,"Wicked canine creatures who live for the thrill of the hunt, yeth hounds often serve evil masters as guardians and trackers. Yeth hounds resemble lean, sleek dogs with overlarge ears and narrow paws that can tread on air as easily as the ground. Despite their canine appearance, yeth hounds are remarkably intelligent, although they rarely display this intelligence except when devising intricate tactics to ensnare their quarry. Their eerie bays echo across the countryside when they are engaged in a hunt, and they particularly enjoy baying to frighten and disorient intelligent creatures. Yeth hound packs can number as many as a dozen members, each working in uncanny communion with its packmates to corner and kill their prey. Yeth hounds like to drag their victims back to their lairs to eat at their leisure, so these lairs often contain discarded treasures from the hounds' previous meals. Yeth hounds despise two things: sunlight and other canines. They hunt only at night if they can, often breaking off their hunt at dawn to retreat to a subterranean lair or den, no matter how close they had come to catching their prey. Yeth hounds usually attack wargs, wolves, and similar creatures on sight, working to drive larger or more powerful canines from their hunting areas when then can't simply overpower and kill them. Evil rangers, bestial demons, and wicked cults are frequently gifted yeth hound servants by fiendish patrons. Such hounds often serve as spies and are quick to turn against those who fail to advance the patrons' wicked aims. The cult of Lamashtu, in particular, is fond of using yeth hounds as temple guardians.",,3
Yeti,"Nearly a myth, the yeti is rarely seen—and even when it is, it is often too late. Yetis dwell amid the highest, most remote peaks of the world, coming down from their snowy mountain holds to raid, steal livestock, and sometimes feed their insatiable urges for slaughter and destruction. Those folks who live at the foot of a yeti-ruled mountain warn of the “abominable snowmen”: monstrous, fur-covered humanoids who leave strange and bloody tracks in the snow. Normally yetis seek to protect the world rather than hunt its other civilized denizens. They do so by lairing near eldritch portals that form links between the Material Plane and other, much stranger dimensions of reality. From within these snow-covered arches and ancient stone doorways, aliens, living nightmares, fiends, and worse can emerge through dimensional networks into the world. Yetis who guard these portals sometimes succumb to these horrors and are corrupted, taking on the bloodthirsty urges and horrific behaviors of the very monsters they strive to protect the world against. Yetis who manifest such violent tendencies are driven out of their clan and forced to wander the mountaintops alone, thus giving rise to the myth of the legendary abominable snowman. Forced to fend for themselves, these exiled yetis often fully embrace the corrupting elements that caused their exile in the first place, growing more powerful and more deadly as a result. The most vile of these yetis turn to cannibalism, not out of need, but out of a sheer joy at the terror they inflict upon their kin. Invariably such cannibalistic yetis attract the attention of wendigos, which makes a bad situation all the worse.",,5
Yithian,"Yithians are strange creatures, defined not by their physical bodies but by their ancient, disembodied minds. As a people, yithians devote themselves to the acquisition of knowledge above all else. They project their minds across the cosmos and take over a creature's body, living within and observing the creature's culture. The yithians then reverse the process and return to their communities, recording all they learned in massive tomes crafted of strange, metal alloys. Yithians erase their hosts' memories of time spent in their bodies; however, these hosts occasionally recall odd images, usually during dreams. These recollections often involve a vast city from which great black towers rise, filling the viewer with dread. Few hosts realize these vague memories harken to their time spent in the yithian's body, when they wandered that alien city. Four flexible and retractable appendages radiate from the top of a yithian's cone-shaped body, two of which end in sharp pincers, which they click and move to communicate, while the third ends in a cluster of funnel-shaped sensory organs. A spherical “head” rounded by three evenly-spaced eyes tops the fourth appendage. Tentacles dangling beneath this head allow for fine manipulation that the large pincers can't manage, while the crown of tentacles rising from the top like strange flowers function as ears.",,9
Young Black Dragon,"Murderous tyrants of marshes, swamps, bogs, and fens, black dragons terrorize their domains with intense fervor. Gleefully sadistic, they rule their fetid principalities from a deep cave or otherwise isolated part of the swamp with a mix of lightning-quick raids and subterfuge. Their hatred for other creatures is as acidic as their breath weapons, and they rarely tolerate even other dragons of their kind—except perhaps to mate or temporarily collaborate to take down a mutual enemy. Black dragons are amphibious—although they breathe air, their gills also allow them to breathe water. Their frills and fins make them accomplished swimmers, well suited to their wetland environments and submerged lairs. They’re immune to the fetid water that comes as a result of their magical ability to corrupt water. Black dragon lairs are as foul as their souls. The floors are littered with rotting meat, and plundered treasures line the muck and slime of their dank caves amid twisted roots and creepers. Such places are often crawling with pests, snakes, and slimes. Though they claim natural caverns when they can, they make do with areas of dense, twisted vegetation within a swamp. Black dragon treasure hoards primarily consist of gems and expensive glass work, as valuables of softer substance can’t survive the dragon’s acidic presence.","Dragon, Black",7
Young Blue Dragon,"Blue dragons are the sleek and poised cosmopolitans of the chromatic dragons. Their brand of evil is organized, manipulative, and regal. Blue dragons often lair near or within cities and set out to bend the population to their will and gather hordes of servants. These dragons love spinning webs of conspiracy. A blue dragon’s lackeys typically don’t even realize that they serve a dragon, but instead think the protection money, tariffs, or taxes they are amassing is treasure for a cruel but legitimate master. In some ways, blue dragons even see their servants as a living hoard and value them like treasure. These dragons have been known to use these tactics even with their own chromatic cousins. Not all blue dragons work clandestinely. Some lord over desert tribes and hill people like vengeful gods, demanding both tribute and worship. No matter how blue dragons manage their underlings, their bearing is regal and their lairs palatial; they’re universally intolerant of insubordination, incompetence, and embezzlement, and punish perpetrators with murderous efficiency. Blue dragons are also known for their use and mastery of illusion magic. They make use of illusions to augment their manipulations and bewilder their foes in battle. Blue dragons also have some control over water, but use this ability to destroy water, something quite dangerous for those who encounter them in their desert lairs. The ideal lair for a blue dragon contains multiple passages, rooms, and secret chambers. As social creatures, blue dragons prefer to host guests in comfort—but their dwellings should not be so public that just anyone can come calling. A force of guards keeps out intruders, and clever illusions conceal the edifice from prying eyes. Rather than a pile of coins or gems, a blue dragon’s true hoard is the rich furnishings in its citadel— expensive art, ornate furniture, and architectural marvels.","Dragon, Blue",9
Young Brass Dragon,"Brass dragons are whimsical tricksters who delight in humor and play. They particularly enjoy conversations with humans and other civilized humanoids, delighting in the naive customs of these diminutive races without showing them haughtiness or scorn. While they may seem merely curious, brass dragons engage in this sort of conversation with the goal of keeping up to date on regional politics so they can anticipate future conflicts. Along the way, they create extensive information networks that begin with their own allies but stretch across all levels of humanoid society—networks which the brass dragon then uses to subtly assist settlements near their lair. Unlike the schemes and manipulations of blue dragons, brass dragons use their informant networks to establish justice and equality. These carefree dragons value independence and feel that all creatures deserve to live as they please, provided they don’t harm others. They are emotional creatures and tend to have short attention spans, sometimes falling victim to depression in their twilight years. To combat this, some brass dragons keep pets and houseplants that they can care for. Though they may seem childlike in their curiosity concerning mortal affairs, a brass dragon’s prowess in battle is no laughing matter. A brass dragon whose territory or allies are threatened is a terrifying foe indeed, quick to shed their innocent guise and unleash their terrifying might upon evildoers. Most brass dragons live in desert climates, and while they keep their lairs hidden, they often build near humanoid settlements.","Dragon, Brass",7
Young Brine Dragon,"Brine dragons are usually blue-green in color, with shiny scales, crests that help them glide through the water, and sweeping neck frills. They care little for either good or evil. As they are both opinionated and willing to impose their sense of order on others, many brine dragons eventually seek to rule over a meticulously crafted community. These communities are orderly and well-planned, with rigid standards of courtesy and unchanging laws set down by the dragon themself. A settlement seeded by a brine dragon can be made of members of almost any ancestry, but the most common inhabitants are humans, merfolk, tengus, or sahuagin.Depending on the dragon's personality, their community members might view their brine dragon ruler as anything from a benevolent force of order to a fearful tyrant. Regardless, the typical brine dragon has little patience for kindness or philanthropy, and the strength and health of their settlement as a whole are of greater concern than individuals' well-being. A notable exception to this dispassion rises when an outside force encroaches on their lands. In these cases, the brine dragon is quick to step in and aid in the defense of their community.Although brine dragons enjoy cultivating settlements, they rarely make their lairs within the city limits, instead preferring to dwell in sea caves or cliffside grottoes overlooking the coastline. Here they can retreat for privacy as needed, or can accumulate and display their gathered wealth in a place where they feel safe spreading out their treasures. Brine dragon hoards often consist of a mix of offerings and taxes paid by those they rule over and strange discoveries salvaged from sunken ships.","Dragon, Brine",8
Young Bronze Dragon,"Bronze dragons are among the most common of metallic dragons and the most likely to ally with mortals on worthy quests. However, they are naturally scholarly creatures who would rather remain in their lairs studying esoteric lore than go off on a wild adventure. These aloof and stoic dragons also act as preservationists, guarding storehouses of ancient lore from destruction or perversion. Bronze dragons are principled and protective, but while their silver cousins are quick to crusade for justice, bronze dragons prefer to find an important location worthy of their protection and guard it against any attack or unwelcome intrusion. Bronze dragons’ mastery over water and affinity for electricity means they are a boon to sailors caught in thunderstorms. A bronze dragon’s enemies quickly discover neither cloudy sky nor turbulent sea provides shelter from their wrath. Bronze dragons lair along shorelines, often in partially submerged sea caves. While all dragons keep hoards of treasure, the hoard of a bronze dragon more resembles a vast library—with the shelves kept carefully above the waterline, of course. In addition to their collections of esoteric lore, bronze dragons keep treasures associated with the sea, such as beautiful scrimshaw, flawless pearls, and equipment inlaid with mother-of-pearl and abalone shell.","Dragon, Bronze",9
Young Cloud Dragon,"At heart, cloud dragons are wanderers, explorers, and travelers who enjoy nothing more than seeing new lands and meeting unusual creatures. Cloud dragons range in color from light blue to a pale, milky white and have thick, curling horns and rather short snouts. They keep lairs among the extreme altitudes of the highest mountain peaks but are away on their many journeys as often as they're at home. Cloud dragons spend long hours surveying the lands they fly over from great heights, but they are creatures of whim, making it hard to predict what will pique their curiosity and bring them winging down to converse or investigate something on the ground. Cloud dragons seldom perform acts of outright malice, but they are not often charitable either. A cloud dragon is as likely to simply pluck something they desire off the ground and fly away with it as they are to bargain fairly.A cloud dragon's ever-changing interests never seem to stray toward the complicated schemes and long-term plans of other dragons. These rovers are creatures of the moment, and although they are as mentally gifted as other true dragons, their interests remain in the here and now. Yet the cloud dragon's penchant for living in the moment is not a personality flaw—they're more than capable of anticipating long-term results of their actions and won't make foolish choices simply to pursue a current interest. At the same time, cloud dragons have little interest in worrying about the future and are as confident in their ability to handle tomorrow's problems as they are today's.Cloud dragon hoards tend to be well-guarded or well-hidden, as a natural result of their roving habits often taking them away from their lairs for extended periods. Their treasuries include a wide variety of items—they are driven to gather a broad range of prizes rather than collecting one type of item intensively. To a cloud dragon, a diversified hoard is a perfect hoard.","Dragon, Cloud",10
Young Copper Dragon,"Capricious and always eager to share a good laugh, copper dragons are among the wiliest of the metallic dragons, but this by no means interferes with their mission to spread freedom in oppressive lands. Copper dragons are hedonists who are quick to indulge in simple pleasures, but they’re also sympathetic to other creatures, slow to pass judgment, and careful to always examine a situation from as many perspectives as possible. This philosophy has its drawbacks, however, as copper dragons are susceptible to negative influences and prone to forgiving the less serious evil acts performed by their chromatic cousins and other cruel creatures. Copper dragons also have a difficult time keeping their temper in check once they are roused to anger. Copper dragons tend to lair in warm or temperate hills, but due to their nature, they move their lairs every few years. They sometimes live among other people, especially any dwarves who reside nearby. Some copper dragons even worship gods typically worshipped only by humanoids. Among these dragons, worship of Cayden Cailean is most popular, as they see his love of freedom and penchant for alcohol aligning with the typical copper dragon mindset. A copper dragon’s combat tactics are as unorthodox as its sense of humor, as it is more likely to use mockery and tricks than outright strength to win its battles. As a copper dragon ages, it perfects jokes capable of rendering its foes helpless with laughter.","Dragon, Copper",8
Young Crystal Dragon,"Good-natured but vain, crystal dragons are beautiful creatures with brilliant hides made of multicolored crystal and gemstone. Their beauty is a source of great pride but is also something of a weakness, as crystal dragons are easily angered by insults about their appearance. Despite their relatively benign natures when compared to other true dragons, crystal dragons can be short tempered and prone to finding insults where none were intended. Although their opinions are changeable, crystal dragons prefer orderly environments and are not fond of sudden interruptions or distractions.Crystal dragons build their lairs in underground grottoes, where they cultivate environments of great beauty. Their exacting standards and vivid imaginations mean that they are always working to improve the appearance or layout of some part of their lair. These lairs are unique to each individual crystal dragon, but there are always plenty of reflective surfaces that allow the dragon to observe their own appearance. These range from crystals to reflecting pools to finely crafted mirrors, which are arranged throughout the lair in a pleasing array. Gifts of well-crafted or magical mirrors are an excellent way to curry favor with a crystal dragon.Although crystal dragons are easily distracted by their sparkling collections or their vanity, they remain good-hearted creatures at the core and make friends quickly. While a crystal dragon tends to find evil creatures uncouth and unpleasant, any other nearby denizen or inhabitant of their home could become fast friends or beloved pets, depending upon the creature's capacity for conversation (and for providing the frequent praise and compliments that crystal dragons hunger for).","Dragon, Crystal",7
Young Forest Dragon,"Forest dragons oversee the endless growth of nature, protect it from plunder, and reclaim ruins for the wilderness. Some say these dragons jealously hoard nature's bounty for themselves while seeing everyone else who tries to benefit from nature as thieves and poachers. They loathe the progress of technology and civilization, preferring the company of monsters and animals. Forest dragons are their forests in a literal sense. Over time, their hair becomes mossy, their hide toughens like bark, and small insects or animals live within them.","Dragon, Forest",10
Young Gold Dragon,"Gold dragons are the epitome of metallic dragonkind, unrivaled in their strength as well as their wisdom. They command the unwavering reverence of all other metallic dragons, who view gold dragons as their leaders and counselors. Golds rival the raw power of even red dragons, much to the chagrin of their chromatic cousins, and the two races are often regarded as bitter rivals. But despite their incredible power, gold dragons are fond of discourse and prefer to talk through solutions to problems rather than rely upon brute strength. Long-lived as they are, they necessarily take a wide view of all situations and never act without considering all possible options and outcomes. Because of this, gold dragons willingly converse with any creature that seeks them out, even evil chromatic dragons. Mortals might find this behavior strange, considering the longstanding war between chromatic and metallic dragons, but dragons know all too well that desperate situations sometimes call for drastic alliances. And although gold dragons might consider brief truces with their chromatic brethren in the case of world-ending threats, they also know when such alliances have run their course. When another metallic dragon faces a quandary or a foe beyond its own ability to overcome, its best option is often to seek the counsel of the eternally wise and gloriously righteous gold dragons. Locating these legendary beings is no easy task, however, for gold dragons are notoriously reclusive. Their intellect and wisdom is such that they prefer to ponder the great questions of life in seclusion, where they strive to formulate solutions to the world's most pressing problems. As a result, gold dragons are sometimes absent when metallic dragons gather together, or are missing from tribunals where their counsel would be beneficial. Impatient dragons sometimes begrudge gold dragons for this apparent unreliability, but such aspersions are usually a result of jealousy rather than any true criticism; in their hearts, other dragons know that few gold dragons purposefully exclude themselves from truly important matters. A gold dragon's incredible foresight and unparalleled enlightenment means they are unlikely to interfere in the business of individual mortals, though the rare person who captures the attention of a gold dragon is fortunate indeed, for there are few beings in the cosmos who can offer such prudent and considerate advice. Rulers and individuals in stations of high power have an easier time of garnering the aid of a gold dragon; entire wars have been avoided thanks to a gold dragon's last-minute intermediation. Gold dragons are often found in warm grasslands and savannas, lands where they can enjoy long, meditative flights without attracting the attention of potential enemies. They tend to sleep either out in the open in a barren, remote place, or within a heavily secreted or fortified lair, such as a forgotten sink hole or in the labyrinthine caverns of a terrestrial chasm. Gold dragons may enlist trusted servants and allies to guard their lairs, though many live truly solitary lives, preferring to protect their hoards with nonlethal traps and magical wards.","Dragon, Gold",11
Young Green Dragon,"Green dragons are the most contemplative of the chromatic dragons as well as the most approachable. The key to understanding green dragons is to understand their obsession with knowledge and self-discipline. Any careful approach that takes advantage of a green dragon’s fixations may end in a diplomatic outcome, but any misstep or slight can provoke a savage attack. Like most chromatic dragons, green dragons do not suffer fools—and the threshold for what they consider foolish is very low. Though more open than their chromatic cousins to dealing with other creatures and dragons, green dragons prefer an isolated and quiet life. They tend to lair in the most forbidding parts of a forest, surrounded by tangled thickets, or else at the heart of some dismal gulch. If the terrain is suitable, some green dragons make their home in natural caves, which they expand to suit their needs. Green dragons’ pride leads them to see to the preservation of their forest homes. They feel that a verdant and lush forest is something that they alone have cultivated. This leads some green dragons to follow the path of druidism, though most prefer to study the arcane arts and occult lore. Most of them delve deeply into one particular field of study, and correspond with other scholars in the field by adopting a pen name that hides their true nature. Regardless of their chosen focus, green dragons seek to improve themselves, and their desire for knowledge makes them more likely to deal diplomatically with other creatures in order to obtain new information. Their hoards are typically well kept, organized, and filled with tomes of lore and scrolls of magic along with antiquities they collect for their own inscrutable reasons. Many of these treasures come from across the globe, and many an adventurer has survived an encounter with a green dragon by stroking its ego and plying it with rare artifacts or lost lore from ancient cultures.","Dragon, Green",8
Young Magma Dragon,"Magma dragons have a reputation among other dragons for being unpredictable and brash. Their temperament and tendency for violent outbursts ensure that the typical magma dragon lives a solitary life, with hatchlings often bickering or fighting to establish dominance among themselves before they leave the nest. A magma dragon always has a reason for their outbursts and can always justify their sudden turns in mood, yet they rarely feel the need to do so.Magma dragons build lairs within volcanically active mountains or deep underground amid vast lakes of bubbling magma. As with all true dragons, magma dragons keep hoards of treasure, but the nature of their searing lairs limits the type of valuables they collect to metals, gems, and items capable of resisting the heat of a volcano's core.","Dragon, Magma",9
Young Red Dragon,"The largest and most powerful of the chromatic dragons, red dragons are a menace to civilizations everywhere, and their strength is rivaled only by their arrogance. Red dragons see themselves as regents and overlords of all dragonkind. With their crowns of crimson spikes and their command of blistering frame, this is no haughty boast in their eyes—only unquestioned fact. Red dragons don’t deign to speak with lesser creatures; they simply dominate and burn, enslaving weaker creatures to act as servants and to look after their lairs while the dragons slumber away. They take pleasure in dominating these creatures, and they demand tribute from their supplicants. Those who anger or disappoint end up eaten or reduced to ash. They command their enslaved minions to constantly build onto their lairs, carving out new tunnels and designing cunning traps that ensure the dragon’s security. Driven by their arrogance, red dragons are the most likely of the chromatic dragons to ravage settlements. They want the world to see them in their rightful place as powerful tyrants, and they delight in threatening all other creatures. They have no qualms about bullying, manipulating, or killing to complete their goals—or simply intimidating others through a public display of brutality and dominance. As legendary as the brutishness of red dragons is the magnificence of their hoards of gold. Their lairs are often situated in dangerous places, with volcanoes being a favorite spot, as they find them foreboding and the constant warmth is comfortable. No matter the locale, red dragons sleep on a litter of coins and other treasures, which they zealously guard. Sometimes, the dragon’s internal heat causes these precious metals to fuse together.","Dragon, Red",10
Young Sea Dragon,"Sea dragons' affinity with water grants them mastery over rain, storms, and floods. Those whose livelihoods are at the mercy of the weather and waves frequently venerate these great aquatic creatures. Most sea dragons respond kindly to requests, but, like the sea, they can be unpredictable and fickle. Sea dragons have disk-shaped scales like fish and webbed claws as well as large back and tail fins to aid in swimming. They appear in vivid and vibrant colors, like aquatic wildlife. Underwater flora and fauna grow and thrive upon older sea dragons, and ancient sea dragons often have a head of coral around their antlers, giving them the image of being crowned royalty.","Dragon, Sea",8
Young Silver Dragon,"Silver dragons are among the most chivalrous of all dragonkind; they wield frost and cold as weapons, can walk on clouds, and dwell high upon snowy mountain peaks or deep in steep, misty valleys. Although they typically make their lairs among the highlands, the pursuit of justice leads silver dragons to travel far and wide—often into the very heart of realms overrun by evil. These exemplars of righteousness are ceaseless in their determination to help the weak, spread honor, and stamp out evil. Silver dragons are sleek and sinuous. Their hides resemble nothing so much as a suit of gleaming armor, lending further credence to the popular myth that silver dragons are the paladins of dragonkind. The zeal with which they seek out, confront, and defeat evil is unsurpassed even among their metallic cousins, and they adhere to strict codes of honor usually passed down from parent to hatchling. On occasion, they instead learn these codes from trusted mentors, usually other silver dragons or gold dragons. As they age, they become even more dedicated to their codes, often adding new and even more restrictive clauses to the systems that guide their behavior. Silver dragons are incredibly altruistic and regularly consort with the citizens of goodly societies, of which they consider themselves protectors and guides. In addition to responding to evil threats, silver dragons work to prevent evil from taking root in the first place, and they ensure mortals under their care are well fed, educated, and treated with dignity. Although silver dragons can seem overzealous or even eager to join the fight against evil, they know that the best way to rid the world of corruption is to stamp out strife and disillusionment at their source, not to passively sit back and watch it grow into an unsolvable problem. Silver dragons can be vindictive, but they can also be forgiving; for evildoers who seek to atone for their sins and turn over a new leaf, the support of a silver dragon is both unwavering and invaluable. Many silver dragons are also drawn to religious endeavors, venerating deities such as Iomedae, Sarenrae, and other deities concerned with justice, virtue, and redemption.","Dragon, Silver",10
Young Sky Dragon,"Sky dragons live above the clouds near the summits of mountains. They maintain a strong religious tradition, a unique practice among imperial dragons that sets them apart as much as their wings do. Desperate souls risk steep cliffs and loose snow to seek these dragons' counsel, and most sky dragons gladly help those who make the journey, but they expel any express hostilities or badger without hesitation. The sky dragon's wings aren't true wings, but long fins fused to their forearms; their scales also form only very slowly. Young dragons coil tightly in their lairs as they absorb minerals that color and harden their scales. Even adults often wrap around pillars out of habit.","Dragon, Sky",9
Young Sovereign Dragon,"The most well-known of imperial dragons due to their deep involvement with mortals, the sovereign dragons' name comes from their mandate of selecting rulers—but at some point, the dragons themselves joined the list of worthy candidates. Other imperial dragons suspect the sovereign dragons offered their connection to the elemental cycle to attain forbidden magic, evidenced by their lack of any vulnerability to wood or ability to feed on fire, despite being creatures of the earth. Most hesitate to question the sovereigns' authority. While some appreciate their impartial nature, others fault this adherence to neutrality. Regardless, the sovereign dragons' charm and centuries of experience in subtle manipulation have made them exceptional negotiators. Almost all sovereign dragons appear gold in color. Their hair ranges from common colors found among humans to bright reds, greens, or blues. They're the only dragons with five digits per claw, a mark of special importance. Other imperial dragons dismiss this claim to status and instead tease the sovereign dragons over their need to wear armor, even while in their draconic forms.","Dragon, Sovereign",11
Young Umbral Dragon,"While the other primal dragons hail from the Elemental Planes, the cruel and unceasingly malicious umbral dragons originate in the depths of the Shadow Plane. Their sleek black scales and serpentine grace allow them to strike from hiding, and they are known for playing with their prey before finally finishing it. These creatures of shadowy energy and unwholesome appetites prefer the necrotic flesh of undead creatures to any other meal. This strange hunger can be of accidental benefit to nearby humanoid societies, but ultimately they hunt and kill undead creatures for the taste, rather than out of any desire to protect others from the undead. The benefit is always short-lived, however. When umbral dragons exhaust their preferred prey, they turn on whatever living creatures happen to be nearby. Umbral dragons sometimes go to great lengths to obtain their favorite meals, even creating undead creatures that they then feast upon.For all their power, umbral dragons are uninterested in fair battles. When faced with foes that pose any kind of actual danger to them, umbral dragons flee into the shadows and seek to strike back through pawns or minions rather than risk their own lives. Their treasure hoards are varied and diverse, often augmented by loot stolen from crypts the dragons have turned into feeding grounds. They have a strong respect for and interest in traditions and heirlooms, and they often seek to augment their hoards with items of great value that have been handed down through the generations of those whose corpses and ghosts they've fed upon.","Dragon, Umbral",11
Young Underworld Dragon,"Underworld dragons embody the pressure between tectonic plates, the heat behind geysers, and flash fires that ignite when the conditions are just right. Natural alchemists, they innately understand reagents and catalysts. While some research the effects of magic on material reactions, the majority of underworld dragons concentrate on building their hoards. They scour the world for carved gemstones and artifacts of precious minerals, both of which they see as distilled essence of earth's bounty. Underworld dragons appear angular and sharp; their scales glow as if superheated from within, and their hair flickers like tongues of flames. An intense fire glows behind their gazes, suggesting they could ignite items with a mere thought, and their breath ripples the air as a testament to the heat contained within their bodies.","Dragon, Underworld",7
Young White Dragon,"The most feral and least intelligent of all the chromatic dragons, white dragons are brutish, predatory, and chiefly motivated by self-preservation. Nearly all other dragons look down on white dragons as hopelessly hotheaded and dull, though this does not make them any less dangerous—in fact, it may mean the opposite. It’s nearly impossible to treat with white dragons, not because they lack the capacity to do so, but because they just don’t care to. They are as difficult to deal with as they are quick to anger, and they become incensed at almost anything. When a white dragon does speak, it spews threats, inane jokes, and incoherent babbling as a prelude to attacking—and when the attack comes, it’s bloody and relentless. Thankfully, white dragons prefer very cold, remote locations that are far from people. Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds. They fly out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass near the dragon’s territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference for items with high utility—such as tools, trade goods, and fine food—over coins or jewels. The ability to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly to their specifications, and they take great pride in how they’ve decorated their homes over the years.","Dragon, White",6
Yzobu,"Yzobus are herd beasts common across northern plains and mountains, resembling a cross between a steer, a sturdy horse, and a yak. They most notably feature a pungent stench caused by bodily secretions building up within their thick, shaggy pelts—a stench so strong that yzobu herds can often be smelled before they appear. Territorial and aggressive, yzobus often attack other creatures on sight. When threatened, a herd launches into a stampede, trampling any in their path and goring survivors with their distinctive horns. Some ranchers trade yzobu hides as a workable leather for mercenaries and guards, but the powerful smell means that most ranchers tend their small herds on the outskirts of towns. Typically, yzobus aren't raised to a specific age, but rather are killed whenever one escapes and poses a threat. The hides require an intensive tanning process with almost constant brushing and hours soaking in salt water—but the effort results in a leather both soft to the touch and sturdy enough to work as an effective armor for several years. Hides aren't the only yzobu products worth harvesting. A female yzobu's milk is rich and nutrient-rich, making it a staple food source in some regions. Their meat is less enticing but still edible. These beasts remain a permanent part of hobgoblin society, where their aggressive temperaments and durable, sturdy bodies are great assets. Hobgoblins possess an immunity to yzobu stench, and they view the fact that other races sickened by it as further evidence of their own superiority. They also highly prize yzobu mounts, and hobgoblin commanders often paint their yzobu's horns in varying colors and patterns to show how many enemies the mount has killed. Yzobu cavalry are a staple of hobgoblin military action, and they played a key role in the recent Ironfang Invasion that led to the formation of the new hobgoblin nation of Oprak in Avistan. The establishment of Oprak meant that many Avistani who had never encountered yzobus before have grown familiar—if not enchanted— with their distinctive odor.",,1
Zaramuun,"Zaramuuns are beings of elemental sand that hide in deserts and wastelands. They disguise themselves as massive dunes before rising up to attack living creatures. The most infamous zaramuuns kill any living creatures they find, but others simply rob their victims of all metal and stone possessions before fleeing. Although zaramuuns insist they are only reclaiming what was taken from their ancestral earth, this is simple self-delusion; most zaramuuns use their stolen goods as payment and material components to conjure fiends, for Zaramuuns were exiled from the Plane of Earth after worshipping fiends who promised to give them power over other elementals. This worship gradually transformed into servitude, and now many zaramuuns believe that if they send enough souls to their masters, they will be set free.",,16
Zealborn,"Zealborn arise from mortals who become consumed by a noble or idealistic vision and choose undeath as a means of pursuing that vision. Unlike liches, who use undeath as a path toward immortality and individual power, zealborn undergo their transformation with the total conviction that their cause is so just it should never die. They manipulate and control dozens of fanatical followers who sacrifice themselves—and rise again as powerful zeal-damned ghouls—for the zealborn's cause.",,12
Zealot of Asmodeus,"Zealots ferret out plots against their religion and seek justice for their church's followers. This zealot serves Asmodeus, but others might serve Abadar, Calistria, Iomedae, Norgorber, Pharasma, Sarenrae, or Zon-Kuthon. They often ride a war horse wearing light barding. This horse is an additional monster in the fight.",Devotees,4
Zebub,"Zebubs serve as Hell's messengers and spies. Their ability to share what they've seen with other creatures makes them especially useful—not only to other devils, but also to mortal conjurers. Some infernal lords unleash them in enormous, horrid swarms upon unsuspecting lands to debase flesh and land alike while collecting secrets the infernal host might later put to use. Zebubs use any opportunity to manipulate weak-willed or easily tempted mortals into serving the zebubs' whims. While arrogant and deceitful, zebubs lack the cunning and confidence of most devils, and thus their schemes often focus on satisfying self-serving or self-destructive ambitions. Zebubs form from the souls of childish and craven mortals, reshaped by the archdevil Baalzebul in the frozen, filthy wastes of Hell's seventh layer, Cocytus.",Devil,3
Zelekhut,"A zelekhut is a bounty hunter and executioner. The zelekhut resembles a mechanical centaur crafted from silvery metal with golden clockwork wings adorning its back. Instead of hands, the zelekhut's arms end in long, barbed chains that crackle with electricity. Whether sent by the powers of Axis or summoned by mortal authorities, the zelekhut seeks out those who continually evade justice—either through active flight, or by abusing their power and station—so as to bring justice to the multiverse's most notorious fugitives and criminals. Indeed, many a zelekhut's quarry are as famous for their ability to evade capture as for the crimes they commit.Though the zelekhut is implacable and unrelenting in enforcing sentences, it does not pass judgments of its own or take the initiative in pursuing targets of opportunity. While hunting a condemned serial killer or notorious thief across half a dozen planes, the zelekhut wouldn't shift a single hoof to capture a corrupt ruler whose offenses are far greater. All zelekhuts understand that laws can and must differ from place to place, and it is not the zelekhut's job to moralize, merely to obey its rightful assignments and track down those who seek to flee their punishment.",Aeon,9
Zephyr Hawk,Zephyr hawks drift among the currents of the Plane of Air in great flocks.,"Elemental, Air",3
Zetogeki,"Basalt comprises the earthen bodies of zetogekis, giant lizards with an innate ability to absorb and redirect kinetic energy. They dwell near active volcanos, particularly at hot springs and geysers, from which they drink copious quantities of steaming, mineral-rich water. Since they have no need for any other sustenance (and in fact can't digest anything else), zetogekis guard these watering holes. The worst fate that can befall the proprietor of a mountain hot spring is the arrival of a zetogeki, which can transform a lucrative business into a public hazard overnight. Mountain dwellers who make use of such hot springs pay monster hunters handsomely to eradicate or chase off zetogekis, but dealing with the stubborn beasts is no mean feat. Even in wilder lands, zetogekis prove menacing to mountaineers. The lizards sometimes purposefully throw themselves down mountainsides to absorb the kinetic energy dealt to them during their tumble. They use this accumulated energy to take down predators—though zetogekis see nearly every other type of creature as a predator. This marvelous ability to absorb and dole out physical energy come from a zetogeki's unique configuration of shale-like scales, which it can angle at will much like a porcupine extending its quills. Those who encounter a zetogeki hunkered down with its scales in the telltale raised pattern of zig-zagging black and gold would do well to give the lizard a wide berth. This danger has its upsides, however; some alchemists and wizards offer substantial bounties for intact zetogeki hides.",,7
Zombie Brute,Necromantic augmentations have granted this zombie increased size and power.,Zombie,2
Zombie Dragon,"The rotted husk of a once great dragon, this abomination has lost all its former splendor, but none of the ferocity. Its patchy, rotted wings don't generate enough lift to keep it aloft, but the foul necromantic energies animating it still allow it to fly, albeit slowly.",Zombie,9
Zombie Hulk,These towering horrors are animated from the corpses of monstrosities.,Zombie,6
Zombie Lord,"Cunning zombie lords command their lesser kin, which they can use in unexpected ways. They have been known to direct or collaborate with husk and withered zombies, creating cells of intelligent zombies hiding within the ranks of mindless undead.",Zombie,4
Zombie Mammoth,"This monstrous creature can overrun defenses and stomp foes into the ground, making it a terror on any battlefield.",Zombie,11
Zombie Owlbear,"Zombie owlbears combine an owlbear's ferocity with mindless undead hatred. Once it draws near, it often stands up, unleashing a guttural, wet roar, before charging into combat without thought of self-preservation.",Zombie,3
Zombie Shambler,A zombie shambler is a slow-moving horror dangerous in larger groups.,Zombie,-1
Zombie Snake,"At around 5 feet long, this massive, rotting serpent lacks potent venom, but its bite still injects putrid fluid that can cause infection.",Zombie,0
Zomok,"Mighty plant-dragons, zomoks prowl the woodlands, defending their homes from destructive forces while healing and restoring the woods following natural disasters and ravaging intruders. Zomoks vary in appearance with the seasons, growing verdant green in the spring and summer, changing to autumnal colors in the fall, and decaying to brown in winter. While zomoks can and often do swallow their foes, they have no real need to eat. Any creature they gulp down is typically left behind as a mangled corpse the next time the zomok travels via their Forest Step ability. Zomoks reach 35 to 40 feet in length and weigh 30 tons.",,16
Zrukbat,"Zrukbats resemble long-limbed bats with gangly wings, which make them clumsy fliers. Instead, these reclusive fey prefer to crawl along surfaces using the hooked talons on the tips of their wings and feet. Their somewhat humanoid faces feature bulging black eyes, dark fur, and pointed fangs, shocking—if not terrifying—those who get a glimpse of them scuttling along a roof or peeping out from under an eave. Sensitive creatures, zrukbats quickly learn that their appearance triggers negative reactions, yet they prefer to live in urban settlements, observing busy streets and houses from inconspicuous locations. Zrukbats hide in plain sight using their shapeshifting abilities to mimic a broad repertoire of objects. Despite their intelligence, they fundamentally don't understand others' reasoning and often make foolish mistakes in their disguises. For example, one might shapeshift into a lit lantern in an otherwise abandoned house, misjudge the pattern of roof ornaments and become an out-of-place spire, or disguise themself as smoke in an unlit chimney. Due to their fearsome appearance and predisposition to conceal themselves, zrukbats are associated with ghosts and other supernatural phenomena. This affiliation isn't wholly earned; as long as zrukbats feel they've gone unnoticed, they remain generally peaceful. When their obsessive secrecy fails, they devolve into extremely volatile, dangerous creatures. Once spotted, zrukbats fly into a rage if anyone utters even a casual suspicion regarding their presence. In areas known to harbor zrukbats, superstition forbids speaking aloud of curious phenomena, lest they take offense and attack.",,2
Zuhra,"Zuhras, the genies of the elemental Plane of Metal, are bold and imposing, fond of being the center of attention and drawing a crowd with flashy performances, displays of skill, and tales of their personal victories. Despite their large personalities, their long-term relationships tend to be cool and somewhat distant; zuhras often make alliances but rarely form friendships, and the trust required for deeper relationships is rarer still. The few mortals who've gotten to know a zuhra often describe them as bombastic but emotionally aloof. Since the reconnection with other planes, zuhras have sought out and formed bonds with other genies. They find their jabali cousins to be capable smithing partners, if a bit staid and dull. Zuhras rarely pay non-genie elementals any more than a passing glance, finding even the intelligent ones uninteresting to communicate with or hard to relate to.",Genie,8
Zuhra Shuyookh,"The most powerful zuhras draw followers and elemental metal with overwhelming force of personality and literal magnetism. When called upon to conduct wish rituals, they use their long isolation from the other planes as an excuse to misinterpret requests outlandishly, claiming linguistic differences.",Genie,13
Zuipnyrn,"This spectacularly odd creature appears every now and again in various traveling circuses around the Inner Sea. Although carnival barkers make any number of claims about this strange being’s origins, the so-called “moon mole” is in fact an alien creature called a zuipnyrn, hailing from a distant planet beyond Golarion’s star system. In their infancy, zuipnyrns are spherical and furry, with few features other than a single eye stalk and a round, toothless feeding hole. A zuipnyrn’s body is particularly soft and malleable, allowing it to withstand falls and other hazards. Its eye stalk has the ability to produce a blinding burst of light as a defensive measure, which allows a zuipnyrn just enough time to escape in times of danger. Even more incredibly, a zuipnyrn can emit a hypnotic aura from its eye to entrance those around it—an ability it uses to avoid conflict and to persuade bystanders into helping it escape perilous situations. As they age and grow, zuipnyrns adapt to their environment by growing additional limbs, sprouting additional sensory organs, developing gills, or otherwise altering their anatomy to suit the area.",,3
Zuishin,"Zuishin are kami warriors and archers who task themselves with watching over important shrines, ancient gates, or sacred doorways. Monasteries secreted away in snowy valleys, pagodas hidden in remote forests, and archways that mark the passage into sacred hidden cities all might host such kami. With sturdy armor and hallowed armaments, zuishin fight tirelessly to drive off any evil powers who wish to desecrate their wards. Of all kami, zuishin most frequently fight against oni, as the wards zuishin guard are most often targeted for desecration by these vile fiends. Most zuishin wear ancient armor and wield powerful weapons like swords and bows, but some might use spears, axes, or only their fists, depending on their ward and the people who make offerings there. Zuishin tend to regard mortals with skepticism. To earn a zuishin's trust, a supplicant might offer items of natural significance, such as an urn of hallowed earth, a branch from an ancient tree, or an arrangement of local flowers. Like all kami, a zuishin might come across as reserved or even indifferent to humans and their ilk; however, this impression stems only from a zuishin's wisdom and longevity, which makes mortal affairs seem relatively trivial. In the company of other kami, however, they're unerringly benevolent and readily offer their aid to their fellows. For example, a zuishin whose ward lies nestled in an ancient forest might readily join forces with kodama in those trees to deter foes.",Kami,10
Zyss Serpentfolk,"Even the least among zyss serpentfolk consider themselves greater than any mammal. Their magical abilities, most notably their telepathy, are all the reason they need to hold this view. And it's true enough that the instinctual skill and magic of any zyss is enough to best the average human.",Serpentfolk,2
