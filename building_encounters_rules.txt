Building Encounters

Table 10.1: Encounter Budget
Threat | XP Budget
Trivial | {trivial}
Low | {low}
Moderate | {moderate}
Severe | {severe}
Extreme | {extreme}

Each creature costs some of the XP from your XP budget for the encounter, based on its level compared to the levels of the characters in your party. For instance, if the PCs are 5th level, a 2nd level creature is a "party level – 3" creature, a lackey appropriate for a low  to moderate threat encounter, and it costs 15 XP in an encounter’s XP budget.
