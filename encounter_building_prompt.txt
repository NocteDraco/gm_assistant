Create three encounters of varying difficulty. For each encounter you must provide the following:

- A one sentence summary of the encounter.
- Chosen threat level for the encounter picked from Table 10.1: Encounter Budget
- XP budget for threat level
- CSV rows of the creatures in the encounters selected from Creature Table 10.3. 
- Total experience of all creatures in the encounter.
- Difference from threat level budget
- A paragraph description of the encounter. 

Guidelines for encounter building:
- Most encounters should have 1-8 creatures
- Use one CSV row for each creature type in the encounter.
- Use different creatures for more diverse encounters

Each row of the CSV should include:

- The creature name
- number of this creature in the encounter
- their relative level
- creature xp using Table 10.2: Creature XP and Role
- creature role using Table 10.2: Creature XP and Role

Guidelines for paragraph description of the encounter:

- Include any player-driven decisions that could be made.
- Create thematically diverse encounters
- Use concise descriptions.
- Allow for roleplay, exploration, or combat.
